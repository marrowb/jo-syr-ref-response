LLM Attribute Definitions
The following attributes are to be generated by an LLM based solely on the narrative elements (e.g., title, description) of each aid activity JSON object. The LLM should use the provided Sector.json file as the authoritative source for IATI 5-digit sector codes and their definitions when classifying the llm_sector attribute. If the information required for an attribute is not clearly present or inferable from the narrative, the attribute should be left blank or assigned an empty list, as appropriate for its data type. The goal is to use broader, easier-to-categorize options where applicable.
1. llm_ref_group
* Purpose: To identify specific refugee nationalities or a general reference to refugees explicitly mentioned in the narrative as beneficiaries or a significant focus of the project. This attribute does not include vulnerable host country nationals (e.g., Jordanians).
* Data Type: List of ENUM strings.
* Possible Values: ["Syria", "Palestine", "Iraq", "Yemen", "Sudan", "Other", "mixed_or_unspecified_refugees"].
   * Multiple values from ["Syria", "Palestine", "Iraq", "Yemen", "Sudan", "Other"] can be selected if the project targets multiple distinct refugee groups from this list.
   * "Other" should be used if a specific refugee group not listed (e.g., Somali refugees) is explicitly mentioned.
   * "mixed_or_unspecified_refugees" should be used if the narrative mentions refugees as beneficiaries or a focus but does not specify their nationality, or refers to multiple groups without detailing them individually in a way that allows for separate tagging. This value should not be used if specific nationalities are identifiable and can be tagged from the other options.
* Clarity: This field should be an empty list [] only if the narrative or project has no mention or indication of focusing on or including refugees. If refugees are mentioned but no specific group is identifiable, ["mixed_or_unspecified_refugees"] should be used.
* Examples:
   * Example 1: Specific Single Group (Syria)
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-OCHA-HPC2022-HJO22-P-NGO-24932):
         * title_narrative: "Multi-sectoral Assistance to Vulnerable Syrian Refugees"
         * description_narrative: "The project aims to provide critical multi-sectoral assistance to vulnerable Syrian refugees in camps (Azraq and Zaatari) and host communities in Jordan. This includes distribution of core relief items, shelter support, and access to protection services for Syrian families."
      * llm_ref_group: ["Syria"]
   * Example 2: Multiple Specific Groups (Iraq, Syria)
      * Narrative (adapted from narratives.txt, XM-DAC-41122-PROG-2018-023 which mentions various vulnerable groups including Iraqi and Syrian refugees):
         * title_narrative: "Protection and Assistance for Urban Refugees"
         * description_narrative: "This project provides legal assistance, psychosocial support, and emergency cash for vulnerable refugees in urban areas of Amman and Zarqa. Key target groups include Iraqi refugees and newly displaced Syrian families facing significant protection concerns."
      * llm_ref_group: ["Iraq", "Syria"]

         * description_narrative: "This project aims to improve the livelihoods of vulnerable households in Irbid and Mafraq. While a significant number of beneficiaries are Syrian refugees, the program is designed to also support other refugee nationalities and vulnerable Jordanians in accessing income-generating opportunities."
      * llm_ref_group: ["Syria", "mixed_or_unspecified_refugees"]
   * Example 4: "Other" Specific Group (if a non-listed group was explicitly named)
      * Narrative (hypothetical, as specific non-listed groups are not prominent in provided narratives.txt for Jordan):
         * title_narrative: "Community Support for Somali Refugees in East Amman."
         * description_narrative: "This project focuses on providing language classes and integration support for Somali refugee families residing in the Hashmi Shamali area of Amman."

* Purpose: To describe the broader categories of populations the project aims to serve, based on explicit mentions in the narrative.
* Data Type: List of ENUM strings.
* Possible Values: ["refugees", "host_communities", "general_population"].
   * Multiple values can be selected. For instance, a project targeting both refugees and the communities that host them would have ["refugees", "host_communities"].
   * "refugees": Used when the project explicitly targets refugees (regardless of specific nationality, which is covered by llm_ref_group).
   * "host_communities": Used when the project explicitly targets the communities accommodating refugees (e.g., vulnerable Jordanians in areas with high refugee presence).
   * "general_population": Used when the project targets the wider population without a primary, explicit focus on refugee/host community dynamics, or if it's a national-level initiative not specifically disaggregated.
* Clarity: If the target population is not clearly delineated in the narrative according to these categories, this field should be an empty list [].

* Purpose: To describe the primary physical or social environment(s) where the project activities are stated to take place, particularly concerning vulnerable populations.
* Data Type: List of ENUM strings.
* Possible Values: ["camp", "urban", "rural"].
   * Multiple values can be selected if activities explicitly occur across different setting types (e.g., ["camp", "urban"] if a project operates in both).
   * "camp": Activities primarily occur within formal or informal refugee/IDP camp settings.
   * "urban": Activities primarily occur in cities or towns.
   * "rural": Activities primarily occur in countryside or non-urban settings.
* Clarity: If the setting is not specified or unclear from the narrative, this field should be an empty list [].
* Examples:

      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-OCHA-HPC2022-HJO22-P-NGO-24932):
         * title_narrative: "Multi-sectoral Assistance to Vulnerable Syrian Refugees"
         * description_narrative: "The project aims to provide critical multi-sectoral assistance to vulnerable Syrian refugees in camps (Azraq and Zaatari) and host communities in Jordan." (Assuming host communities here are primarily urban/peri-urban based on typical settlement patterns).

At the household level, USAID is helping families stretch limited water by improving the efficiency of water use for their daily needs. ... Community interventions will focus on northern Jordan where host communities are most impacted..."
      * llm_ref_setting: ["urban", "rural"] ("On-farm" implies rural; "household level" in "northern Jordan" host communities likely includes urban/peri-urban areas).
   * Example 6: Unclear Setting
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-DAC-41302-32317 -0 -2012-JOR152):

4. llm_geographic_focus
* Purpose: To list specific sub-national administrative areas, cities, or regions within the host country (e.g., Jordan) that are explicitly mentioned in the narrative as locations for project activities.
* Data Type: List of strings.
* Possible Values: Extracted names of locations (e.g., "Amman", "Zarka", "Irbid", "Mafraq governorate", "northern Jordan"). The value "national" can be used if the project is explicitly described as having a nationwide scope. If only the country name (e.g., "Jordan") is mentioned without further sub-national detail, and the scope isn't explicitly "national", then the country name can be used.
* Clarity: If no specific sub-national locations, "national" scope, or country-level mention is present, this field should be an empty list [].
* Examples:
   * Example 1: Specific Governorates/Cities
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, GB-CHC-1065972-P1807JDN01):

      * llm_geographic_focus: []
5. llm_sector
* Purpose: To assign the LLM's best guess of relevant IATI sector codes based on the project's description in the narrative. The LLM must use the provided Sector.json file as the authoritative source for IATI 5-digit sector codes and their definitions.
* Data Type: List of strings.
* Possible Values: Valid IATI 5-digit sector codes found in the provided Sector.json file.
* Clarity: If a relevant sector cannot be reasonably and confidently inferred from the narrative by matching to definitions in Sector.json, this field should be an empty list [].
* Examples:
   * Example 1: Education Sector
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, KR-GOV-030-1342000_2024_018):
         * title_narrative: "Bridge Programme Phase 2 (Jordan) : Strengthening literacy skills and accessibility in education of children in Jordan"
         * description_narrative: "Expanding a reading program for children nationwide in Jordan, training experts in children's literacy education, and hosting forums to promote literacy education among children."
      * llm_sector: ["11220", "11130"] (Based on Sector.json: 11220 "Primary education"; 11130 "Teacher training". "Expanding a reading program for children" aligns with primary education. "Training experts in children's literacy education" aligns with teacher training.)
   * Example 2: Child Labour / Labour Rights

In particular, it will build the capacity of the Child Labour Unit (CLU) of the Ministry of Labour (MoL) to coordinate the implementation of the National Framework on Child Labour (NFCL)..."
      * llm_sector: ["16070"] (Based on Sector.json: 16070 "Labour rights" - Description includes "fundamental principles and rights at work (child labour, forced labour...)". This is the most direct fit.)
   * Example 3: Emergency Multi-sectoral Relief (including WASH elements)
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-OCHA-HPC2022-HJO22-P-NGO-24932):

6. llm_nexus
* Purpose: To categorize the project's primary aim(s) along the humanitarian-development spectrum based on its narrative description.
* Data Type: List of ENUM strings.
* Possible Values: ["humanitarian", "development"].
   * Multiple values can be selected if the project clearly and substantially integrates both humanitarian and development objectives and approaches (e.g., ["humanitarian", "development"]).
   * "humanitarian": The project primarily focuses on saving lives, alleviating suffering, and maintaining human dignity during and in the aftermath of crises. It seeks to mitigate harms faced by vulnerable populations in the present.
   * "development": The project primarily focuses on addressing underlying causes of poverty and vulnerability, and building sustainable systems, institutions, and capacities for long-term improvement in quality of life. It seeks to build durable solutions over time.
* Clarity: If the nexus is not clearly inferable from the narrative for either category, this field should be an empty list []. If only one aspect is clear, only that tag should be used.
* Examples:
   * Example 1: Humanitarian
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-OCHA-HPC2022-HJO22-P-NGO-24932):
         * title_narrative: "Multi-sectoral Assistance to Vulnerable Syrian Refugees"

         * description_narrative: "...This four-year project (2010 – 2014) will prepare the ground for the country to move towards this. It builds on the previous IPEC Action Programme and Country Programme (2002 – 2007) also supported by the US Department of Labor (USDOL)..."
      * llm_funding_org: ["US Department of Labor", "USDOL"] (Capturing both full name and acronym if present).
   * Example 2: Multiple Funders (Hypothetical based on common patterns, as narratives.txt doesn't always clearly list funders in descriptions)
      * Narrative:
         * title_narrative: "Joint Education Program for Refugee Children"
         * description_narrative: "This initiative, funded by UNICEF and the European Union, aims to increase school enrollment for refugee children..."
      * llm_funding_org: ["UNICEF", "European Union"]
   * Example 3: Funder Mentioned in Title/Context (Illustrative)
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, US-EIN-13-2600780-REG2017JORDAN0001 - where US-EIN implies US funding, USAID often mentioned):
         * title_narrative: "Jordan Valley Water Resilience Initiative"
         * description_narrative: "...At the household level, USAID is helping families stretch limited water..." (If USAID is explicitly stated as funder or the narrative strongly implies it through phrasing like "USAID's project...")
      * llm_funding_org: ["USAID"] (If explicitly mentioned as funding or primary agent).
   * Example 4: No Funder Clearly Mentioned in Narrative Snippet
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, KR-GOV-030-1342000_2024_018):
         * title_narrative: "Bridge Programme Phase 2 (Jordan) : Strengthening literacy skills and accessibility in education of children in Jordan"
         * description_narrative: "Expanding a reading program for children nationwide in Jordan, training experts in children's literacy education, and hosting forums to promote literacy education among children."
         * (Note: transaction_provider_org_ref might list "KR-GOV-030", but the instruction is to use narrative elements only for these LLM fields).
      * llm_funding_org: []
8. llm_implementing_org
* Purpose: To list the names of organizations explicitly mentioned in the narrative as being responsible for carrying out the project activities (implementing partners).
* Data Type: List of strings.
* Possible Values: Names of organizations as they appear in the narrative (e.g., "ILO", "Mercy Corps", "Ministry of Education").
* Clarity: If no implementing organizations are clearly mentioned in the narrative, this field should be an empty list [].
* Examples:
   * Example 1: Clear Implementing Org
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-DAC-41302-29137 -1277 -2012-JOR153, part of it):
         * description_narrative: "...it will build the capacity of the Child Labour Unit (CLU) of the Ministry of Labour (MoL) to coordinate the implementation... This follows the five-year project of the ILO with the SSC..." (If ILO is implementing the current phase activities).
         * If clearer: "The International Labour Organization (ILO) will implement this project by working with the Ministry of Labour."
      * llm_implementing_org: ["International Labour Organization", "ILO", "Ministry of Labour"] (If both are actively implementing parts or jointly).
   * Example 2: Government Body as Implementer
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, KR-GOV-030-1342000_2024_018 - inferring from context, as explicit implementer often not in short descriptions):
         * title_narrative: "Bridge Programme Phase 2 (Jordan) : Strengthening literacy skills and accessibility in education of children in Jordan"
         * description_narrative: "Expanding a reading program for children nationwide in Jordan, training experts in children's literacy education, and hosting forums to promote literacy education among children." (If a sentence like "The Ministry of Education will lead the expansion..." was present).
         * The transaction_provider_org_narrative for this entry lists "Ministry of Education". If the LLM is guided to consider such fields if the description is sparse, it could be picked up. Based solely on the description above, it's weak.
      * llm_implementing_org: ["Ministry of Education"] (If explicitly stated or strongly implied as leading the activities).
   * Example 3: Multiple Implementers
      * Narrative (Hypothetical):
         * title_narrative: "Community Health Outreach"
         * description_narrative: "This project will be jointly implemented by Mercy Corps and the Jordan Health Aid Society, focusing on mobile clinics and health awareness sessions."
      * llm_implementing_org: ["Mercy Corps", "Jordan Health Aid Society"]
   * Example 4: Implementing Agency Mentioned for a Component
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-DAC-7-PPR-4000001728):
         * description_narrative: "...At the household level, USAID is helping families stretch limited water by improving the efficiency of water use for their daily needs..."
      * llm_implementing_org: ["USAID"] (If USAID is directly carrying out these activities, not just funding them). Often USAID funds other implementers. The narrative needs to be clear.
   * Example 5: No Implementing Org Clearly Mentioned in Narrative Snippet
      * Narrative (from narratives.txt, XM-DAC-41116-PROPARCO-CJO1023):
         * title_narrative: "Development of Al Rajef Wind Power Project"
         * description_narrative: "Financing of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of an 89.1 MW wind farm..." (This describes what is being financed, not who is doing the construction/operation, unless the recipient of finance is named as the actor).
      * llm_implementing_org: []
