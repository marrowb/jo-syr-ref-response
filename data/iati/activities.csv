This activity targets water conservation at both the community level and within the agriculture sector by promoting practices to preserve, protect, and utilize water resources more efficiently. WIT aims to leverage the use of technologies through improved public awareness, capacity-building and institutional-strengthening measures, and private sector incentives like financing..          Through this activity, USAID is working with companies that sell irrigation technologies to farmers and providing them with information, technologies, equipment, and services to reduce the use of water in the agriculture sector, which currently accounts for 52 percent of water use in Jordan. This will improve on-farm water management practice and yield greater profitability for farmers. At the household level, USAID is helping families stretch limited water by improving the efficiency of water use for their daily needs. At the community level, USAID is introducing simple, proven interventions, such as water harvesting and cistern storage, to benefit households and institutions. Outreach efforts will raise awareness in the community on the importance of water conservation in order to promote behavior change and will increase the visibility of water conservation technologies in order to facilitate wider adoption of these solutions.

The investment will begin in Amman because the completion of the billion-dollar Disi water supply system from southern Jordan will result in a substantial increase in NRW losses in Amman and requires a sustained program to reduce these losses.  The activity will later be expanded to Aqaba and Zarqa.  Through the use of a Fixed Amount Reimbursment Agreement (FARA) mechanism with Miyahuna, the NRW Activity aims to assist Miyahuna in decreasing NRW that is lost through leakage, illegal use, or inaccurate billing in selected zones of Amman through detection, repair, and remediation projects, and collecting the baseline data for possible future public-private partnerships in continued repair, operations and maintenance of the system.

The investment will begin in Amman because the completion of the billion-dollar Disi water supply system from southern Jordan will result in a substantial increase in NRW losses in Amman and requires a sustained program to reduce these losses.  The activity will later be expanded to Aqaba and Zarqa.  Through the use of a Fixed Amount Reimbursment Agreement (FARA) mechanism with Miyahuna, the NRW Activity aims to assist Miyahuna in decreasing NRW that is lost through leakage, illegal use, or inaccurate billing in selected zones of Amman through detection, repair, and remediation projects, and collecting the baseline data for possible future public-private partnerships in continued repair, operations and maintenance of the system.

The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.\nThe intervention’s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida’s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR, etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach – PBA).\nNRC's catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC's advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC's analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC's portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden's development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.\nSida’s contribution to NRC for 2022 will cover around 6.5% of NRC’s total financial requirements of the supported programmes and projects. It will provides humanitarian services to almost 9 million persons (53% female). HUM adds 50 MSEK for NRC's 2022 country programme in Ukraine benefiting 90,000 people with protection, shelter, WaSH and cash assistance. Decision 5 April. Amendment nr. 5.\nHUM adds 7.5 MSEK for NRC's 2022 country programme in Cameroon from the 2022 mid-year allocation (food security, legal advice for 600 households/4200 individuals in Logone-et-Chari, Mayo Sava and Mayo Tsanaga). Decision 9 June 2022. Contract amendment No 6.\nHUM adds 10 MSEK for NRC's 2022 country programme in South Sudan from the end-of-the-year allocation. Decision 16 November 2022 nr 2022-002341. Contract amendment No 7.\nNRC targets 7.7 million unique beneficiaries in total within Sida-funded humanitarian programmes in 2023, (52% female), who will receive protection and humanitarian services from NRC: Education, WASH, Shelter and settlement, Food security and livelihoods, including multi-purpose cash assistance, Protection, Legal assistance, Humanitarian mediation (community-based peace-building). Advocacy and support to humanitarian coordination and durable solution to displacements working groups in the field are part of NRC's engagement that Sida is funding. NRC's annual budget 2023 in the settings and thematics prioritized by Sida amounts to 5620 million Norwegian crowns in total. Sida's share weighs so far 8% of it: NRC's third largest donor whose cumulated 2021-2025 grant is 80% softly earmarked (programme-based approach) and 34% multi-year.\nEarlier granted multi-year funding for 2023 was disbursed in January (52 MSEK) in support to continued humanitarian operations in DR Congo, Mali and Nigeria with strong emphasis on emergency response."", 'Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingrådet (NRC) - har ansökt om ett förnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025.\n\n2021\nNRC har dessutom ansökt om finansiering på 364,5 miljoner SEK för att genomföra humanitära insatser i 26 humanitära krisområden under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ansökan inkluderar även 40 miljoner kronor för den humanitära snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i stöd till sju projekt för metodstöd, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.\n\nDen aktuella budgeten för NRC:s hela humanitära program 2021 uppgår till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del för närvarande utgör ca 8%. Sida ger NRC möjligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt så kallad Programme-Based Approach – PBA)\n\nHumanitär-Utveckling-Fred Nexus\nNRC bidrar i hög grad till arbetet för att sammankoppla humanitärt bistånd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens strävan att effektivisera biståndet genom katalytiskt stöd till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer möjliggör och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och påverkansarbete till att stärka hållbara lösningar för flyktingar och människor som har blivit tvångsfördrivna och bidrar därmed till att på sikt minska de humanitära behoven. Även krisdrabbade människors möjligheter till självförsörjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet är en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomförs av NRC:s internationella center för övervakning av tvångsförflyttning (IDMC) är av stor vikt för dessa analyser. 19 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portfölj som Sida finansierar avser länder där Sverige även bedriver utvecklingssamarbete vilket öppnar för möjligheter till synergier med humanitärt bistånd.\n\n2022\nNRC ska få totalt 455,5 miljoner kronor av Sidas humanitära finansiering, enligt följande fördelning:\n\n- Sida kommer att stödja NRC:s humanitära program i 23 krissituationer som Sida har prioriterat genom sin behovsbaserade allokeringsmodell för 2022, med 288,5 miljoner kronor :Afghanistan, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia och\nregionen (Ecuador, Panamà), Demokratiska republiken Kongo, Etiopien, Irak, Jemen,\nJordanien, Kamerun, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Moçambique, Niger, Nigeria,\nPalestina, Somalia, Sudan, Sydsudan, Syrien, Uganda, Venezuela.\n\n- Flerårig finansiering för NRC :s humanitära program i Demokratiska\nrepubliken Kongo, Mali och Nigeria inleds 2022 och Sida har för ändamålet att ta i anspråk 104 miljoner kronor från kommande års anslag från erhållen Bemyndiganderam förutsatt att Riksdagen anvisar tillräckliga medel.\n\n- NRC:s akuta insatser vid plötsligt uppkomna kriser kommer att stödjas genom Sidas snabbinsatsmekanism (RRM) under 2022 med 50 miljoner kronor.\n\n- NRC:s metod- och kapacitetsstärkande projekt för skydd, miljö och IDMC (Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre) kommer under 2022 att få 13 miljoner kronor, varav 3 miljoner kronor från Sida/Globen för IDMC.\n\nSidas bidrag till NRC för 2022 kommer att täcka cirka 6,5 % av NRC:s totala finansiella behov för de stödda programmen och projekten. Det kommer att tillhandahålla humanitära tjänster till nästan 9 miljoner människor (53 % kvinnor) i Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia och regionen, Demokratiska republiken Kongo, Etiopien, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Moçambique, Niger, Nigeria, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Syrien, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen.\n\nHUM lägger till 50 MSEK för NRC:s landprogram 2022 i Ukraina som gynnar 90,000 människor med skydd, tak över huvudet, WaSH samt kontantbistånd.

NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida\'s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC\'s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida\'s humanitarian unit\'s annual budget appropriation.\n\nThe objectives of NRC can be summarized as follows: ""To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.""  NRCs main activity is delivery of humanitarian assistance through programme activities in the field. NRC specializes in six areas of expertise, or ""core competencies"": shelter and settlements; livelihoods and food security; information, counselling and legal assistance (ICLA); education; camp management; and water, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH). Protection is lifted up as a new core competency of NRC since 2021. NRC engages closely with the affected populations to understand their needs and capacities, ensuring it tailors its assistance accordingly and involve them in the entire programme cycle, from design through implementation to evaluation. NRC advocates for respect for the rights of displaced and vulnerable people.\n\nIn 2021, the NRC Board approved the Global Strategy 20222025. The strategy\nsets out four sub-objectives for areas that NRC will continue to strengthen and further institutionalize, namely, 1. assistance to hard-to-reach populations, 2. humanitarian policy, 3. protection, and 4. durable solutions. It also points to four areas of work that will be accelerated through expanded engagement and investments: i) advocacy, ii) climate and environment, iii) collaboration with  local actors, and iv) quality programming.\n\nNRCs work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\xa0Sida\'s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC\'s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025.\n\nThe interventions tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sidas funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR, etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach  PBA).\n\nNRC was granted funding to carry out the Humanitarian Programme for 2022 in 24 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Irak, Jordan,  Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Moçambique, Niger, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Ukraina, Venezuela and Yemen. The grant includes provision of funding replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and four individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.\n\n\n\nSida\'s assessment on performance and results\n\nAlike many other actors in the sector, NRC excels in reporting activities and outputs, but should be better in catching what changes and impacts its interventions have resulted to ultimately on assisted communities. The reporting of data and results does not provide necessarily an accurate and consolidated overview of what NRC has achieved. Sida has notified NRC that it should provide dis-aggregated data by age in targeting and reporting which is a norm.\n\nIt is assumed that NRC will achieve its objectives in 2023 again, but the global stress on the current resource mobilisation system supporting humanitarian action may affect NRC as well, similarly to large humanitarian actors such as the ICRC.']",['Sweden'],"['Sweden', 'NRC/Norwegian Refugee Council', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency', 'NRC/Norwegian Refugee Council']",766db1109007c5abc3fe2d7df1ab08cb,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],['refugees'],"['camp', 'urban', 'rural']","['Jordan', 'Afghanistan', 'Cameroon', 'Central African Republic', 'Colombia', 'Ecuador', 'Panama', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Eritrea', 'Ethiopia', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Kenya', 'Lebanon', 'Libya', 'Mali', 'Niger', 'Nigeria', 'Honduras', 'El Salvador', 'Mexico', 'Palestine', 'Somalia', 'South Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Tanzania', 'Burundi', 'Uganda', 'Venezuela', 'Yemen', 'Bangladesh', 'Burkina Faso', 'Mozambique', 'Syria', 'Ukraine']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['Sweden', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency', 'Sida', 'Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'DG ECHO', 'UNHCR']",['NRC/Norwegian Refugee Council'],2025-06-04T09:10:59.406755

Det nu aktuella stödet till Internationella Rödakorskommittén (ICRC) baseras på Sidas humanitära allokeringsprocess, som färdigställdes under slutet av 2017. \n\nAktuell insats bygger vidare på tidigare års stöd till ICRC, där Sverige, bland annat genom Sida, har varit en av ICRC:s betydande givare åtminstone sedan 1953. Sidas årliga stöd till ICRC befästes 2014 då ett strategiskt partnerskap, genom ett treårigt avtal, signerades. Det treåriga avtalet förlängdes senare för att också inkludera 2017. Ett nytt treårigt avtal (2018-2020) föreslås nu för att möjliggöra en fortsatt strategisk ansats i relation och partnerskap med ICRC. Det nu föreslagna stödet avses kompletteras med ytterligare stöd genom beslutade avtalsändringar och kompletterande insatsbeslut för åren 2018-2020, under förutsättning att riksdagen anvisar nödvändiga finansiella medel samt baserat på bedömd relevans i kommande allokeringsprocesser. \n\nFör 2018 föreslås att 450 miljoner SEK allokeras till ICRC för implementeringen av insatser i 36 kontexter (varav 8 är regionala och därmed täcker flera länder). Av den initiala allokeringen utgör 115 miljoner SEK oallokerat stöd, vilket ger ICRC flexibilitet att tillskjuta ytterligare finansiella medel till länder och regioner med ökade humanitära behov eller som är kraftigt underfinansierade. Sida måste dock, enligt avtal, godkänna ICRC:s förslag på hur det oallokerade stödet allokeras. För överblick och fördelning av stöd hänvisas till avtalets bilaga III (Budget summary). \n\nFör 2019 och 2020 föreslås att 5 miljoner SEK allokeras till ICRC per år som oallokerat stöd, vilket ger ett totalt beslutsbelopp om 460 miljoner SEK. \n\n**********\n\nBAKGRUND\n\nICRC utgör en av de främsta humanitära aktörerna i länder och kontexter med väpnad konflikt, med ett mandat i den internationella humanitära rätten (IHR). ICRC:s övergripande mål är att skydda liv och värdighet hos människor utsatta för väpnad konflikt och andra situationer av våld, genom bland annat att säkerställa evakuering från krigszoner, upprätthållande av temporära boendelösningar (shelter) och basala förnödenheter såsom mat, vatten och sanitet. ICRC:s målgrupper är definierade inom IHR och utgörs av civila, frihetsberövade, sårade och sjuka. Efter att ha gjort en behovsanalys kombinerar ICRC fyra metoder för att, direkt eller indirekt, på kort, medellång eller lång sikt, arbeta för att upprätthålla respekt för liv, värdighet och fysiskt samt psykiskt välbefinnande hos dem som drabbas av väpnade konflikter och andra situationer av våld. Dessa metoder syftar till att förhindra (förebyggande), utrota orsaken (skydd) och lindra (bistånd/materiellt stöd) mänskligt lidande i en väpnad konflikt eller andra situationer av våld samt att stärka Röda Kors/Halvmåne-rörelsen (samarbete). Uppföljning och utvärdering är också avgörande för denna process, liksom samordningen med de många aktörer som finns på den alltmer komplexa humanitära scenen.\n\nICRC presenterade sin humanitära appell för 2018 under december månad 2017. Detta är en givargemensam appell och budget, indelad efter länder samt regioner. Sida begär inte in en egen ansökan eller budget. ICRC inkom också i december 2017 med ett förslag på hur ett eventuellt stöd från Sida skulle fördelas på landprogram, baserat på humanitära behov och finansiella resurser. \n\nICRC:s totala budget för 2018 uppgår till 2,016.8 miljoner CHF (c:a 17 miljarder SEK), varav 218,4 miljoner CHF (c:a 1,8 miljarder SEK; motsvarande 10,8 % av den totala budgeten) går till huvudkontorets särskilda appell, vilken utgår från huvudkontorets verksamhet. Huvudkontorsappellen stöds årligen av UD, med kärnstöd uppmätt kring cirka 100 miljoner SEK per år.  Resterande budget om 1,798.3 miljoner CHF (c:a 15,1 miljarder SEK) går till ICRC:s insatsappell, vilket är en ökning med  11,6 % jämfört med 2017. Ökningen beror främst på att de humanitära behoven i världens oroshärdar har fortsatt att öka. Det är till insatsappellen Sida allokerar sitt stöd. \n\nICRC:s 10 största insatser sett till budget är Syrien, Irak, Sydsudan,  Jemen, Nigeria, Somalia, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Afghanistan, Ukraina och Myanmar. \n\nICRC:s verksamhetsmål ligger i dess övergripande humanitära uppdrag att vara en opartisk, neutral och oberoende organisation fast förankrad i den internationella humanitära rätten, i syfte att skydda liv och värdighet hos de som drabbas av väpnade konflikter och annat våld och att ge dem bistånd och materiellt stöd. ICRC:s mervärde som humanitär aktör i väpnade konflikter ligger bland annat i organisationens unika möjlighet att ha tillträde i svåra kontexter samt deras möjlighet att nå ut till mottagarna bland annat genom samarbetet med de nationella rödakors- och rödahalvmåneföreningarna. ICRC har detta unika mandat och möjlighet till tillträde i svåra kontexter tack vare sin förankring i den internationella humanitära rätten. ICRC har också möjlighet till konfidentiell dialog med majoriteten av parterna till en konflikt och kan därigenom diskutera och påverka respekt för den internationella humanitära rätten och skydd för exempelvis civila. ICRC har en djup kunskap om dynamiken i konflikter och våldsamma situationer. ICRC gör kontinuerliga riskbedömningar lokalt och har visat kapacitet att anpassa sin verksamhet därefter. ICRC är i ständig dialog med de olika parterna i en konflikt. Enligt ICRC:s ramverk för projekthantering ska konflikt och kontextanalys göras innan insatser genomförs i svåra kontexter. Detta är en förutsättning för att ICRC ska kunna verka. \n\n**********\n\nSida bedömer att samtliga medel för 2018 ska utbetalas i början av året för att ICRC ska ges förutsättningar att planera och genomföra humanitära insatser utan fördröjning. ICRC omsätter regelmässigt utbetalda medel i nära anslutning till utbetalning och förbrukar gåvomedel inom verksamhetsåret.\n\n**********\n\nBedömningspromemorian har skrivits på engelska med anledning av att engelskspråkig personal i fält är delaktig i beredning och uppföljning av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirektörens beslut om Sidas språkvalsmatris med tillämpningsanvisningar från den 1 mars 2013.', 'Each year Sida undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all on-going\nhumanitarian crises are analyzed, and where the partners most relevant to respond to\nidentified needs in each specific crisis are selected. The initial funding to the ICRC in\n2018, which is being encompassed in this decision, is thus based on the Sida\nhumanitarian allocation process that took place in late 2017. A three-year agreement is\nhowever suggested to be signed with the ICRC, where additional contributions will be\nadded to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and\nSida needs assessments.\nFor 2018, it is proposed that 450 MSEK is allocated to the ICRC for the implementation\nof activities in 36 contexts (of which 8 are regional and covers several countries). Out of\nthe initial allocation 115 MSEK is proposed to be unallocated, which would enable the\nICRC to flexibly add additional financial contributions to countries and regions with\nincreased needs or that are severely underfunded. Sida must, as per the agreement,\napprove the ICRC suggestion on how the unallocated funds are to be allocated.\nAn additional 10 MSEK (5 MSEK per year) is allocated to the ICRC as unallocated\nfunding for 2019 and 2020, respectively.', 'The ICRC mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance.

The contribution is relevant for all objectives in the strategy, with an emphasis on the strategy area on protection and assistance to crisis affected populations.\n\nOut of the initial allocation, a segment is proposed to be un-allocated, which would enable the ICRC to swiftly allocate already pre-existing financial contributions to countries and regions which experience a crisis in a sudden onset, a deteriorated or a severely underfunded situation.

The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.\nThe intervention’s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida’s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR, etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach – PBA).\nNRC's catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC's advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC's analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC's portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden's development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.\nSida’s contribution to NRC for 2022 will cover around 6.5% of NRC’s total financial requirements of the supported programmes and projects. It will provides humanitarian services to almost 9 million persons (53% female).

Advocacy and support to humanitarian coordination and durable solution to displacements working groups in the field are part of NRC's engagement that Sida is funding. NRC's annual budget 2023 in the settings and thematics prioritized by Sida amounts to 5620 million Norwegian crowns in total. Sida's share weighs so far 8% of it: NRC's third largest donor whose cumulated 2021-2025 grant is 80% softly earmarked (programme-based approach) and 34% multi-year.\nEarlier granted multi-year funding for 2023 was disbursed in January (52 MSEK) in support to continued humanitarian operations in DR Congo, Mali and Nigeria with strong emphasis on emergency response."", 'Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingrådet (NRC) - har ansökt om ett förnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025.\n\n2021\nNRC har dessutom ansökt om finansiering på 364,5 miljoner SEK för att genomföra humanitära insatser i 26 humanitära krisområden under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen.

Sida ger NRC möjligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt så kallad Programme-Based Approach – PBA)\n\nHumanitär-Utveckling-Fred Nexus\nNRC bidrar i hög grad till arbetet för att sammankoppla humanitärt bistånd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens strävan att effektivisera biståndet genom katalytiskt stöd till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer möjliggör och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och påverkansarbete till att stärka hållbara lösningar för flyktingar och människor som har blivit tvångsfördrivna och bidrar därmed till att på sikt minska de humanitära behoven. Även krisdrabbade människors möjligheter till självförsörjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet är en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomförs av NRC:s internationella center för övervakning av tvångsförflyttning (IDMC) är av stor vikt för dessa analyser. 19 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portfölj som Sida finansierar avser länder där Sverige även bedriver utvecklingssamarbete vilket öppnar för möjligheter till synergier med humanitärt bistånd.\n\n2022\nNRC ska få totalt 455,5 miljoner kronor av Sidas humanitära finansiering, enligt följande fördelning:\n\n- Sida kommer att stödja NRC:s humanitära program i 23 krissituationer som Sida har prioriterat genom sin behovsbaserade allokeringsmodell för 2022, med 288,5 miljoner kronor :Afghanistan, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia och\nregionen (Ecuador, Panamà), Demokratiska republiken Kongo, Etiopien, Irak, Jemen,\nJordanien, Kamerun, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Moçambique, Niger, Nigeria,\nPalestina, Somalia, Sudan, Sydsudan, Syrien, Uganda, Venezuela.\n\n- Flerårig finansiering för NRC :s humanitära program i Demokratiska\nrepubliken Kongo, Mali och Nigeria inleds 2022 och Sida har för ändamålet att ta i anspråk 104 miljoner kronor från kommande års anslag från erhållen Bemyndiganderam förutsatt att Riksdagen anvisar tillräckliga medel.\n\n- NRC:s akuta insatser vid plötsligt uppkomna kriser kommer att stödjas genom Sidas snabbinsatsmekanism (RRM) under 2022 med 50 miljoner kronor.\n\n- NRC:s metod- och kapacitetsstärkande projekt för skydd, miljö och IDMC (Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre) kommer under 2022 att få 13 miljoner kronor, varav 3 miljoner kronor från Sida/Globen för IDMC.\n\nSidas bidrag till NRC för 2022 kommer att täcka cirka 6,5 % av NRC:s totala finansiella behov för de stödda programmen och projekten.

NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida\'s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC\'s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida\'s humanitarian unit\'s annual budget appropriation.\n\nThe objectives of NRC can be summarized as follows: ""To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.""  NRCs main activity is delivery of humanitarian assistance through programme activities in the field. NRC specializes in six areas of expertise, or ""core competencies"": shelter and settlements; livelihoods and food security; information, counselling and legal assistance (ICLA); education; camp management; and water, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH). Protection is lifted up as a new core competency of NRC since 2021. NRC engages closely with the affected populations to understand their needs and capacities, ensuring it tailors its assistance accordingly and involve them in the entire programme cycle, from design through implementation to evaluation. NRC advocates for respect for the rights of displaced and vulnerable people.\n\nIn 2021, the NRC Board approved the Global Strategy 20222025. The strategy\nsets out four sub-objectives for areas that NRC will continue to strengthen and further institutionalize, namely, 1. assistance to hard-to-reach populations, 2. humanitarian policy, 3. protection, and 4. durable solutions. It also points to four areas of work that will be accelerated through expanded engagement and investments: i) advocacy, ii) climate and environment, iii) collaboration with  local actors, and iv) quality programming.\n\nNRCs work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.\xa0Sida\'s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC\'s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025.\n\nThe interventions tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sidas funding in a proportion of 8% approximately.

OCHA är en entitet inom FN-sekretariatet, som har av FN:s generalförsamling (resolution 46/182, december 1991) erhållit ett mandat att stödja samordning av humanitär respons. Den verkar globalt genom sitt huvudkvarter i New York och Geneve, 29 landkontor och sex regionala kontor.  \n\nDen FN-ledda humanitära samordningen är en prioriterad fråga för svensk humanitär politik. Sverige har sedan grundandet av OCHA bidragit både med ett stort finansiellt och ett viktigt politiskt stöd. Sverige är idag efter USA och Storbritannien den tredje största givaren till OCHA och Sidas stöd har på senare år stått för cirka hälften av det totala svenska bidraget. Sverige är också en av de största givarna till OCHA:s humanitära fonder, både landfonderna (CBPF) genom Sida och den centrala nödfonden (CERF) genom bidrag från UD. \n\nOCHA verkar i en global humanitär miljö där de humanitära behoven och komplexiteten ständigt ökar. I 2018 är 136 miljoner människor i behov av humanitärt bistånd i 25 länder, av vilka de flesta är i konflikt. Trots att den humanitära finansieringen totalt sett har ökat växer gapet mellan finansiering och behov. Under senare år har enbart dryga hälften av behoven finansierats och i 2018 vädjar man om sammanlagt om 22,5 miljarder dollar för att svara upp mot de FN-ledda gemensamma responsplanerna. Samtidigt måste systemet förhålla sig till allt fler förlängda och kroniska kriser, ofta på grund av avsaknaden av hållbara politiska lösningar. Komplexiteten av kriserna fördjupas ytterligare av klimatrelaterade risker och naturkatastrofer. Även det humanitära systemet ändras och diversifieras i takt med att en allt större del av responsen hanteras av lokala, nationella och regionala aktörer.   \n\nMot ovan beskriva globala humanitära kontext OCHA:s mervärde bedömer Sida att behovet av effektiv humanitär samordning är fortsatt mycket stort. Därför är ett fortsatt stöd till OCHA:s samorning i fält motiverat. De samordningsmekansimer som OCHA tillhandahåller är en förutsättning för en behovsbaserad, välprioriterande kollektiv respons.\n\nOCHA:s mervärde som humanitär aktör utgår från dess unika mandat, där den som icke-operativ aktör kan agera som en oberoende facilitator och samordnare mellan de humanitära organisationer som deltar i en respons, både internationella och nationella. \n- Samordningsfunktionen innefattar bland annat den årliga planeringscykeln, där OCHA för samman sektorgrupperna (sk. klustren) för att analysera behovsbilden för att sedan ta fram en gemensam humanitär responsplan (Humanitarian Response Plan, HRP). De gemensamma responsplanerna är ett viktigt led i att prioritera de mest akuta behoven och på så sätt även utnyttja knappa finansiella resurser på ett effektivt sätt. Sida erfar att genom OCHA:s och i vissa fall starka humanitära koordinatorers (Humanitarian Coordinator, HC) insatser har responsplaner blivit mer prioriterande och till större grad begränsade till livräddande insatser. Samtidigt finns det fler exempel på att gemensam planering med utvecklingssystemet, som i längden kan bidra till att minska humanitära behov. \n- I sin roll som oberoende facilitator kan OCHA också agera å det humanitära systemets vägnar mot myndigheter och militär, och på så sätt till exempel förhandla om humanitärt tillträde. Detta kan innebära både förhandling om passage för enskilda hjälpinsatser över konfliktgränser, om större regelverk kring tillträde, eller exempelvis frågor kring registrering av organisationer och arbetstillstånd för humanitär personal i länder där myndigheter på så sätt skapar hinder för en effektiv respons. Den här typen av samlade insatser är av stor betydelse i den allt mer restriktiva miljö som organisationer arbetar i. \n- Ett ytterligare exempel på den unika kompetens som OCHA tillför är dess informationsprodukter och data-analys, som används som verktyg för operativa beslut och underlag för humanitärt påverkansarbete. \n\nSida bedömer att OCHA:s mervärde kommer under kommande år ytterligare öka i takt med att den strikt sektorbaserade responsen blir mindre relevant i förlängda kriser, och inte minst genom att flersektoriella modaliteter som kontantbaserade stöd vinner mark.  \n\nDenna insats bygger vidare på tidigare års stöd till OCHA och särskilt det avtal som Sida haft med OCHA under den tidigare strategiperioden 2014-18. Det utgångna avtalet inkluderade två-åriga finansieringsåtaganden för att bidra till förutsägbarheten av OCHA:s finansiering. Flerårig finansiering är särskilt värdefullt för OCHA, vars budget består primärt av löner.  \n\nDet nya avtalet som föreslås är fyraårigt i linje med OCHA:s strategiska plan 2018-21. Insatsen är uppdelad i två komponenter. Den huvudsakliga komponenten består av stöd till OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor och kompletteras av ett mindre metodstöd till Gender Standby Capacity Project (GenCap) och Protection Standby Capacity Project (ProCap), som OCHA-står värd för.   \n\n1. OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor \n\nStödet till OCHA:s fältkontor ges icke-öronmärkt till kontorens verksamhet i enlighet med OCHA:s strategiska plan och den årliga verksamhetsplanen och budgeten (OCHA Plan and Budget). Fältkontoren bidrar till alla fem av OCHA:s kärnfunktioner genom att: (1) samordna den kollektiva humanitära responsen, inklusive genom gemensamma behovsbedömningar och responsplaner; (2) bidra med informantionsprodukter och analys; (3) driva påverkansarbete för att skydda drabbade människor och förhandla humanitärt tillträde, (4) bidra till humanitär policy och (5) mobilisera humanitär finansiering. Insatsen kompletterar Sidas stöd till de humanitära landfonderna (ref. 52040531) som också hanteras av OCHA:s landkontor men finansieras direkt ur givarmedel till fonderna.\n\nSida genomför årligen en humanitär allokeringsprocess, vari samtliga humanitära kriser analyseras utifrån de humanitära behoven och där de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utväljs. Det nu aktuella stödet till OCHA baseras därigenom på Sidas humanitära\nallokeringsprocess, vilken färdigställdes under slutet av 2017. Det föreslagna stödet till OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor är 118 miljoner kronor i 2018 och föreslås fördelas enligt nedan. \n\nLandkontor, totalt 84 miljoner kronor: Afghanistan 3, Burundi 1, Kamerun 4, Centralafrikanska republiken 5, Tchad 4, Colombia 2, DRK 7, Etiopien 2, Haiti 1, Irak 3, Libyen 1, Mali 4, Myanmar 2, Niger 4, Nigeria 4, Pakistan 3, Palestina 4, Filippinerna 1, Somalia 5, Sydsudan 5, Sudan 3, Syrienkrisen 10 (inklusive Regional HC's Office, Syrien, Turkiet, Libanon och Jordanien), Ukraina 1, Jemen 5.  \n\nRegionala kontor, totalt 14 miljoner kronor: Asien (Bangkok) 4, Södra och östra Afrika (Nairobi) 2, Mellanöstern och Nordafrika (Amman) 2, Stillahavsregionen (Suva) 1, Västra och centrala Afrika (Dakar) 4, Latinamerika (Panama) 1. Av stödet till Asien-kontoret kommer 2 miljoner fördelas till OCHA:s verksamhet i Nordkorea.  \n\nEtt särskilt bidrag på 20 miljoner kronor föreslås att avtalas och utbetalas som oallokerat stöd, som OCHA kan använda under året för plötsligt uppkomna, kraftigt förvärrade eller underfinansierade kriser. De oallokerade medlen regleras genom avtalet som fastställer att OCHA ska inkomma med kompletterande underlag som skriftligen ska godkännas av Sida före medlen kan nyttjas av OCHA.\n\nInnanför bemyndiganderamen föreslås ett bidrag om 25 miljoner kronor för 2019, 5 miljoner kronor för 2020 och 5 miljoner kronor för 2021. De slutliga bidragen för 2019-21 kommande definieras som en del av Sidas årliga, behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess och kräver separata beslut och avtalstillägg, under förutsättning att riksdagen anvisar nödvändiga finansiella medel.  \n\n2. GenCap och ProCap \n\nStöd till GenCap och ProCap föreslås med 7 miljoner kronor för 2018, av vilka 4 miljoner kronor fördelas till GenCap och 3 miljoner till ProCap, i enlighet med den årliga GenCap-och ProCap-appellen. Syftet med projekten är att skicka ut tekniska rådgivare inom gender och skydd till stöd för den kollektiva humanitära responsen på landnivå. Uppdragen har ett systemfokus och verkar inom ramen för etablerade samordningsmekanismer, och kan därför ses som ett tematiskt komplement till stödet till OCHA. OCHA kommer inom kort inkomma med ett nytt strategiskt ramverk för GenCap och ProCap. Sidas bidrag avser att täcka kostnaderna för de utsända experterna genom vidareförmedling till Norska flyktingrådet (NRC), som ansvarar för administrationen av expertrostern och uppdragen.      \n\nVad gäller utbetalningar bedömer Sida att samtliga medel för OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor ska utbetalas omgående. Detta för att på bästa sätt möjliggöra planering och genomförande av den humanitära insatsen utan fördröjning. Enligt OCHA används Sidas tidiga bidrag i nära anslutning till utbetalningen. Ett avsteg från Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms därför motiverat. Medel till GenCap och ProCap (7 miljoner kronor) betalas ut först efter att OCHA inkommit med kompletterande underlag i form av ett slutligt strategidokument, slutlig appell för 2018, och ett för Sida godtagbart utkast på resultatsramverk och en uppföljnings- och utvärderingsplan. Det sistnämna bedöms vara tillgängligt under andra kvartalet 2018, alltså beräknas utbetalning ske senast i juni. En senare utbetalning är motiverad eftersom det handlar om ett metodstöd, dvs. är inte av livräddande karaktär.   \n\n\nAvtalsutkastet har tagits fram i samråd med ansvarig jurist på JUR och bygger på tidigare avtalsformat kompletterat med en ny reglering av parternas ambition att motverka anti-korruption. Skrivningen i artikel 11 skiljer sig åt i några avseenden jämfört med Sidas avtal med OCHA om stödet till de humanitära landfonderna (se beslut 2018-000231). Skillnaderna avser rapportering av ärenden och ansvaret för utredningar vilka regleras något olika beroende på om FN:s interna regelverk för Sekretariatet gäller när OCHA har ett samlat ansvar för genomförandet (såsom i det föreslagna stödet) jämfört med rollen som koordinator inom FN-systemet vad gäller landfonderna genom vilket ansvaret är fördelat på de implementerande organisationerna. Som stöd för den föreslagna lydelsen har OCHA delat gällande regelverk för Sekretariatet mot antikorruption (beslutat Sept 2016: ”United Nations Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework” ) och även delat det interna regelverket för upphandling som gäller för hela FN-systemet (”United Nations Procurement Manual, revision 7”Juli 2013). Sida bedömer att regelverken är tillfredsställande.\n\nBedömningspromemorian har skrivits på engelska med anledning av att engelskspråkig personal i fält är delaktig i beredning och uppföljning av insatsen, i enlighet med generaldirektörens beslut om Sidas språkvalsmatris med tillämpningsanvisningar från den 1 mars 2013 (när så är motiverat).\n\nDenna insats har förlängts med 1 år och Sida har tillskjutit nya medel om SEK 125 miljoner. Insatsen har samma mål som ovan och har förlängts för att anpassa sig till OCHAs nya strategiska plan samt invänta MOPANs alla rekommendationer. Insatsen löper under perioden jan - december 2022."", 'The contribution consists of support to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) through funding to its country and regional offices.

In this regard, ABA ROLI has secured the commitment of Jordans new Minister of Justice, as head of Jordans Anti-Human Trafficking National Committee, to support this project (see Sect. 9 of this proposal). ABA ROLI will work with these institutions to conduct an analysis of past TIP court cases in order to identify how the adjudication process can be strengthened. This analysis will inform training workshops for judges and prosecutors and the development of recommendations to strengthen Jordans TIP law. ABA ROLI will also expand the cadre of experts developed under its previous TIP program. ABA ROLI will also work with the Ministry of Justice, National Center for Human Rights, and local NGOs to achieve the second project objective of increased awareness and protection of legal rights of potential TIP victims. This project objective will be achieved by broadening NGO capacity to identify trafficking crimes and their victims. ABA ROLI will support local NGOs in reaching migrant workers and advising them of their rights and how to access legal assistance. To support the workers, ABA ROLI will also train lawyers to provide legal aid to trafficking victims.

International aid alone is not enough to sustain these populations, and innovative solutions of helping affected populations secure their livelihoods are sought. One way of doing this is increasing refugees access to financial services and formal credits, as the lack of access to financial services can act as an impediment in improving and strengthening the economic empowerment of individuals, especially for those already poor and/or otherwise vulnerable. Microfinance entrepreneurial loans have over the past decade served marginalized and vulnerable populations worldwide, but they have not yet been properly introduced in protracted refugee settings.\n\nSida is together with Grameen Credit Agricole Foundation (GCAF) and UNHCR planning to set up a partial credit guarantee intervention for a financial inclusion programme, which aims at improving access to credit for refugees and host communities in Uganda and Jordan for income generating activities and possibly consumption smoothing.\n\nThe programme will follow a market-based approach which involves partnering with the Foundation, whom will be providing debt funding to three to four selected Financial Service Providers (FSPs). The FSPs will in their turn extend their credit products to refugees and host communities. \n\nAs an initial step in the establishment of the financial inclusion programme, the Foundation and UNHCR, have launched a market assessment study with the objective of\nUnderstanding the need and market potential of credit for refugees; \nPromoting livelihoods and improve resilience of refugees and host communities.\n\nFor the study, the Foundation and UNHCR wish to appoint a qualified consultant to conduct the assessments, which should constitute an in-depth analysis of the demand for financial and non-financial products and services among refugees and their host communities in the selected geographical areas, with the aim of gaining a robust understanding of this market’s unmet financial needs and opportunities for FSPs of serving them. The assessment will also look at challenges and barriers, including aspects of doing no harm and conflict sensitivity, as well as more technical aspects of client’s affordability and credit worthiness through for instance a cash flow analysis.\n \nThe main findings of the assessments will be made public, so that other providers on the market can gain an understanding of the business case of serving refugees and hopefully open up for an extension of available financial services offered refugees thus strengthening their livelihood opportunities.\n \nThe main contribution, to which the findings of this report will be relevant and to which this particular component is preparatory, has been considered in line with the State Aid regulations.\nFor a contribution to be deemed as state aid it must contain all of the following conditions: 1. Aid is given by a government and with governmental funds 2. Aid may affect the market balance and competition 3. The aid gives a company either economical or productivity advantages 4. The aid affects the trade balance between involved member states. We do not consider all the mentioned conditions to be met in this contribution.', 'Cirka 70 % av världens flyktingar befinner sig idag i utdragna flyktingsituationer som varar i snitt 17 år. Internationellt bistånd räcker inte längre till för att livnära dessa människor, och innovativa tillvägagångssätt sökes för att kunna hjälpa flyktingarna att säkra sitt eget uppehälle. En lösning skulle kunna vara att öka flyktingars tillgång till finansiella tjänster och formella krediter. Avsaknaden av denna typ av åtkomst kan agera hinder av en individs möjlighet att förbättra sin ekonomiska självförsörjning och självständighet, speciellt i fall där individen redan har otillräckliga finansiella möjligheter eller på annat sätt är sårbar.  \n\nEntreprenörsmikrokrediter har funnits tillgängliga för marginaliserade och sårbara grupper under en längre tid, men de har inte ännu blivit introducerade i flyktingsituationer i någon större utsträckning.\n\nSida planerar tillsammans med stiftelsen Grameen Credit Agricole Foundation (GCAF) och FNs flyktingorgan, UNHCR, att sätta upp ett projekt för att öka finansiell inkludering av flyktingar genom en partiell kreditgaranti. Projektet kommer att ha som syfte att förbättra flyktingars och deras värdsamhällens tillgång till krediter för inkomstgenereraden aktiviteter och eventuellt utjämning av konsumtionsutgifter i Jordanien och Uganda.\n\nProjektet kommer att följa ett marknadsanpassat tillvägagångssätt vilket involverar ett partnerskap med GCAF, vilken kommer att bistå tre eller fyra leverantörer av finansiella tjänster (Financial Service Providers) med lånefinansiering. Dessa leverantörer kommer sedan att erbjuda sina kredittjänster till flyktingar och värdsamhällen.\n  \nSom ett första steg i etablering av projektet har GCAF och UNHCR lanserat en markandsundersökningsstudie som dels avser undersöka behoven, potentialen och utrymmet på marknaden för krediter för flyktingarna, samt finna vägar att stärka flyktingars och värdsamhällens försörjningsmöjligheter och öka deras motståndskraft. \n\nGCAF och UNHCR önskar finna en kvalificerad konsult som kan utföra undersökningen, vilken kommer att innefatta en djupgående analys av behovet och efterfrågan av såväl finansiella som icke-finansiella produkter och tjänster hos flyktingar och värdsamhällen i de geografiska områden projektet riktar sig mot. Syftet är att få en gedigen förståelse för flyktingarnas icke tillgodosedda finansiella behov och leverantörernas möjligheter att möta dem. Undersökningen kommer också gå igenom potentiella hinder och utmaningar kopplade till att erbjuda flyktingar mikrokrediter, bland annat att genom en kassaflödesanalys se över låntagares finansiella utrymme för skuldsättning samt kreditvärdighet. Analysen kommer att ta i beaktande konfliktkänslighets- och så kallade ’do no harm’ aspekter för att försäkra att de risker projektet medför för berörda individer är kända och kan behandlas i insatsens utformning.\n\nDe huvudsakliga slutsatserna kommer att offentliggöras med syfte att sprida kunskapen om det affärsmässiga mervärdet som finns i att tillgängliggöra finansiella tjänster till flyktingar. Detta med förhoppningen om att fler kommer att erbjuda flyktingar krediter, och på så sätt stärka deras försörjningsmöjligheter på längre sikt.\n\nDenna insats är av förberedande karaktär till den huvudsakliga garantiinsatsen och slutsatser från undersökningen kommer att föda in med relevant information till dess utformning. \nHuvudinsatsen har utretts utifrån gällande statsstödsregler och bedöms inte innehålla statsstöd.\nFör att klassas som statsstöd skall en insats uppvisa samtliga följande fyra karakteristika förutsättningar: 1) stöd ges av en medlemsstat och med statliga medel; 2) stödet snedvrider eller riskerar att snedvrida konkurrensen; 3) stödet innebär ekonomisk fördel för vissa företag eller viss\nproduktion och 4) stödet påverkar handeln mellan medlemsstaterna (samhandelskriteriet).']",['Sweden'],"['Sweden', 'Grameen Credit Agricole Microfinance Foundation', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency', 'Grameen Credit Agricole Microfinance Foundation']",d10f353658208bf8b2f4addf3c3d8980,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",[],"['Uganda', 'Jordan']",['development'],"['Sweden', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency']","['Grameen Credit Agricole Microfinance Foundation', 'UNHCR']",2025-06-04T09:14:37.900850

This allows them to obtain a diploma in two years, with which they can continue studying, find a job or start their own business. The project is being implemented in three densely refugee populated districts in Jordan, namely Marka, Mafraq and Hashmi. By bringing the expertise of Plan International Jordan, Johud (local implementing partner) and technical partner Aflatoun, the project offers a concrete future perspective for Syrian and Jordanian girls and boys who have not gone to school because of the crisis.', ""The crisis in Syria has been going on for seven years and poverty among Syrian refugees in Jordan is huge. They live in crowded neighborhoods with very limited facilities. Many parents find it unsafe in Jordan and want to protect their daughters against sexual violence. Additionally, they are looking for ways to feed their children. Resulting in marrying off their daughters. A third of the girls are married before the age of fifteen. This is disastrous for girls as 96% of married girls do not return to school or work. This also applies to unmarried girls who are kept at home. They are completely isolated from the outside world. The boys are mainly sent out to earn money for the family. Half of Syrian children work. Often it is poorly paid, irregular and unsafe work, without protection. In a quarter of the families, the child is even the family's breadwinner. Going to school is not an option for this group of young people. There are regular schools where the government has made room for Jordanian and Syrian children. However, the target group of this project cannot join as the government prohibits young people who have not been to school for more than three years to participate in regular education. They may take part in non-formal education in mainstream schools, but the quality of education is low due to overcrowded classrooms, insufficient teaching materials and poorly trained teachers.  An important reason that Syrian youths are not working is that they were unable to finish their school because of the crisis. They cannot find a regular job with a market-level salary without a degree from a (professional) study program. For girls, the situation is even worse: once married, they no longer work. Our experience is that it is therefore extremely important to talk to the parents and convince them on the need for education of girls, for their own development and to contribute to family income."", 'Plan International, together with its partners, JOHUD and Aflatoun, is working on two result areas that start in parallel and lead to the main objective of bringing back to school the most vulnerable Syrian girls and boys between 12 and 24 years and their Jordanian peers, without training or decent work.\nThe Talents Unlimited project starts with the recruitment and selection of young people who will take part in route 1 or route 2. \nAdolescents aged between 13 and 17 are eligible for the alternative curriculum. All young people first take an assessment to determine their level in order to join the right level. The alternative education curriculum is fixed and made by the government. This allows young people to obtain a diploma in two years with which they can transfer to further education. Girls and boys aged 12 cannot start alternative education according to the law. In order to ensure that they do not end up on the streets or at home, they receive a one-year transition program. The transitional classes consist of various activities. After this they can move on from 13 years to alternative education.\nThe Talents Unlimited project also ensures that young people between the ages of 18 and 24 who have not attended education for more than three years get a chance to receive vocational training. This gives them the prospect of relevant work and obtaining an income. This is done by facilitating access to the right vocational training, as well as by giving good guidance and transition to the labor market or starting up your own company.', ""In 2017 Plan International and JOHUD started a small pilot to offer training and employment to one hundred Syrian youngsters between 16-24 years. This project will end at the end of 2018. Talents Unlimited can build on the learning experiences of this project.This program contributes to the achievement of the government's objectives for 2018-2020 in the field of education and employment of young people between the ages of 12 and 24. Non-formal education is offered at the regular government schools. JOHUD is the only NGO that can also offer non-formal education in Jordan. JOHUD has so far provided non-formal education to a limited number of young people in three centers in Jordan. This program increases JOHUD's capacity to provide non-formal education by adding an extra shift in two centers, and by extending it to a third nearby center.\nIn addition to alternative education, the project also offers psychosocial support, recreational activities, digital skills and life skills, so that young people can process traumas, develop social and cognitive skills and develop themselves. This enriches the curriculum of the alternative education of the government and helps the most vulnerable groups to return to school and obtain a diploma. The awareness activities about the importance of education for all reinforce the Back to School campaign that JOHUD carries out in collaboration with the government."", 'The educational trajectory is for 2,000 adolescent girls (60%) and boys (40%), who have not been to school for 3 years and therefore cannot return to regular education. Age: 12-17 years. 70% of these are Syrians and 30% are the remaining peers in Jordan.\nThe employment trajectory is for 1,000 young adult women (60%) and men (40%), who have no work, have not been to school for 3 years and therefore cannot return to mainstream education. Age: 18-24 years. 70% of these are Syrians and 30% are the remaining peers in Jordan.', 'Through the project, adolescents (12-17) can follow alternative education and transitional classes in three centers of JOHUD. This allows young people to obtain a diploma in 2 years with which they can transfer to further education. In addition, adolescents are offered extra skills that regular education does not offer. This includes: Life skills; Psychosocial support and recreational activities; basic skills for reading, writing and arithmetic; and ICT skills. Girls and boys aged 12 cannot start alternative education according to the law. In order to ensure that they do not end up on the streets or at home, they receive a one-year transition program. After this they can move on to alternative education. After two years of alternative education, the girls and boys will do exams and if they pass, they obtain their diploma. After this they are supported with and encouraged to do a follow-up training. \nThe project also ensures that young people (18-24) who have not attended education for more than 3 years get a chance to receive vocational training. This gives them the prospect of relevant work and an income.  A market analysis is done to see which vacancies there are and to determine the relevant markets for business start-up. Once selected, beneficiaries are prepared for the vocational training. They receive training in life skills, financial skills, ICT and entrepreneurship. Based on market analysis, level and interest, they are linked to the appropriate vocational training. After the completion of vocational education, a part of the graduates is guided to a job. The young people who want to start their own business are helped to make a business plan. If this plan is good enough, they will receive a start-up package.  There are always extra ambitious young boys and girls who want to learn more or want to specialize. The project offers the best-performing students a chance for a scholarship for a follow-up program.', ""This project supports Syrian girls in their fight for equal treatment. This happens in particular because the parents, the girls and the environment are well informed about the importance of education and self-development thanks to the information and awareness sessions in the community and the life skills program. \nThe market research and the assessments ensure that the vocational training courses better match the demand of the labor market. In addition, the extra life skills and digital skills increase the career opportunities on the labor market for young people. \nThe project also contribute to social cohesion, one of the government's spearheads, because we not only offer Syrians with a training or a job, but also Jordanian peers. \nThe graduate youth and their families will become financially independent. Since they are either supported in obtaining a job or start a business that gives them their own income. Once they have enough income they can also let their brothers, sisters and children go to school. This helps not only the young people themselves but also the next generation to build a better future. Because of our focus on girls and young women, we mainly ensure that this target group can break the spiral of poverty for themselves and for their children.""]",['Plan International Netherlands'],"['Plan International Jordan', 'Plan International Netherlands', 'Nationale Postcode Loterij']",b286d66e3f798beec1d83741cc28d058,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",['urban'],"['Jordan', 'Marka', 'Mafraq', 'Hashmi']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Nationale Postcode Loterij'],"['Plan International Netherlands', 'Plan International Jordan', 'JOHUD', 'Aflatoun']",2025-06-04T09:17:41.199473

The project will enable a safe and healthy educational environment for approximately 2,000 children attending 8 primary schools in low income areas of Amman, The project will focus mainly on reconstruction of educational and sanitary facilities, access to drinkable water through water tanks and water filters, electricity installation, roof repairs and installation of safety elements in schools.', 'Konflikt v Sýrii a utečenecká kríza na Blízkom východe majú veľký dopad na vzdelávací system v Jordánsku, najmä na sektor verejného školstva.

Yet by 2015, approximately 80% of these artisans had left their trade, and fled to neighbouring states in search of safety and security (Jordan Times Online, 2016) resulting in a grave threat to Syria's cultural heritage. However, whilst there remains a marginal community of artisans in Syria, the forcibly displaced Syrian artisans in Jordan are reviving their cultural heritage crafts by operating in Jordan's informal economy and adopting economic and cultural survival strategies to create their own pathways and networks to provide a livelihood for themselves and their families. The vast majority of Syrian refugees are living in extreme poverty earning below the Jordanian poverty line equivalent to US$ 96 per person per month (UNHCR, 2016). They are living with minimal prospects for economic, social and cultural development and integration.    This project addresses Jordan's development challenges arising from the burgeoning influx of forcibly displaced Syrians by exploring the resilience, vulnerabilities and identities of the forcibly displaced Syrian artisans residing in Jordan since the war in Syria erupted in 2011. Doing so will help us answer questions about the socio-political impact of engaging in cultural heritage crafts on the forcibly displaced Syrian community in Jordan, the impact of cultural appropriation through 'made in Jordan' Syrian cultural heritage products on the conservation of the Syrian cultural heritage by the forcibly displaced artisans, and the impact of displacement and the arising marginalised masculinities, on the resilience of neo-patriarchal displaced Arab communities. Indeed, focusing on their resilience will help us to understand how the forcibly displaced artisans overcome social, economic and political vulnerabilities, and thus, how they respond to economic and social upheaval. In doing so, we contribute to the rapidly growing resilience discourse which has largely ignored the resilience of forcibly displaced artisans, and forcibly displaced Syrians.  Mixed methods will be used to collect data from multidisciplinary stakeholders and 80 forcibly displaced Syrian artisans residing in Jordan. In addition, the project has three capacity building components. The first is to enhance Jordan's social research capacity by training postdoctoral researchers, and the second advances the largely misunderstood social enterprise model by training trainers to deliver a social enterprise start up programme for forcibly displaced artisans. The third focuses on the forcibly displaced artisans by offering them social enterprise start up training and mentoring. Stakeholder engagement is a key focus of the project and thus an introductory event and dissemination event will be held in Amman - Jordan. The introductory event will help to alleviate any suspicions about the project's aims, and the dissemination event will focus on research, practice and policy development for the forcibly displaced.  The project will be realised through the interdisciplinary strengths of the team of investigators and project partners. Haya Al-Dajani (Principle Investigator) brings a gender, enterprise and displacement expertise, whilst Geoff Wilson (Co-Investigator) is an expert on resilience and Marta Rabikowska (Co-Investigator) is an expert in the creative industries and visual and sensorial methods. The Jordanian Partner the King Hussein Foundation Information and Research Centre is an internationally recognised centre focused on socio-economic planning and transformation through research, advocacy and knowledge transfer. The second Jordanian Partner - Tiraz is a unique non-profit cultural foundation and cultural heritage research centre dedicated to promoting and preserving the threatened Arab cultural heritage."", 'The Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) supports cutting-edge research to address challenges faced by developing countries.

Less well documented are the huge efforts being made by displaced people and associated relief agencies to deal with the challenges of displacement and migration. There are a host of temporary 'pop-up', as well as more established arts, heritage and cultural programmes which are aimed at displaced people who are currently in transition, for example in camps, and those refugees who have reached their resettlement destination. The impact of these programmes on participants' health and wellbeing has often been overlooked in relation to their overall health and how such cultural programmes contribute to recovery, adjustment and other challenges associated with displacement. By working in collaboration with a UK based arts and mental health charity and a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, we wish to better understand the role of creative arts and cultural activities in improving the health and wellbeing. We will also explore the potential for the arts to play a central role in improving issues associated with resettlement, employability and learning new skills, and consider how this could feed into relevant policies such as those related to immigration.  New research shows how damaging displacement is for people's physical and mental health, overall wellbeing and opportunities to flourish, such as employability. Along with issues such as the loss of a sense of belonging, identity and isolation, research shows that refugees and displaced people are more likely to experience mental health problems, such as major depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. These problems arise from the trauma associated with exposure to violence and difficulties encountered in the migration journey, as well as migration-related difficulties in their countries of resettlement such as issues with immigration, employment and income.    Jordan hosts the highest number of Palestinian refugees of all five fields of United Nations operations. Those 1.95 million registered Palestinian refugees constitute over 40% of all registered refugees in the Near East. The first Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan were established almost 60 years ago following the 1948 Israeli-Arab war. Since then, the refugees had to craft their lives away from their homeland and traditional support systems. The current situation of refugees is complex as the new generations suffer limited access to resources, poverty and poor environmental conditions while at the same time continue to live a non-ending temporary situation inside camps. The frustrations of alienation and poverty have led to depression, anxiety and frustration. This has been addressed through interventions in camps, usually partnering with local organisations, addressing mental health through arts or culture. However, these activities are usually conducted without a systematic assessment of process or impact. Similarly, in European camps and refugee organisations, the impact of arts programmes has not been assessed in relation to overall health and wellbeing.  To understand the impact of creative and cultural activities we will collect evidence from displaced people by working closely with them and charities and organisations in the UK and Jordan. We will use this information to inform the development of a new method for collecting evidence which takes into account the health and wellbeing of displaced people and we will co-produce a toolkit which has a more integrated and holistic approach to care. This toolkit will be made widely available and will have relevance for anyone working with vulnerable audiences. We will also create a range of other outputs, including a short film to be produced by displaced people and refugees, which will provide an opportunity for them to decide which stories are told and to take back ownership of their own journeys of displacement."", 'The Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) supports cutting-edge research to address challenges faced by developing countries.

It has affected particularly the neighboring states. For example, Jordan currently hosts approximately 650 000 registered Syrian refugees, whilst total Syrian population in Jordan is estimated as 1.4 million.\n\nWomen are often among the vulnerable groups particularly affected by the Syrian crisis. According to a vulnerability mapping conducted by UN Women, situation for the Syrian refugee women is difficult, particularly to find employment. Some of the contributing factors include the current legislation and the low number of work permits for refugee women, the cultural norms, as well as lack of education possibilities for women. Women are also often more affected by gender-based violence. These same factors also affect the most vulnerable Jordanian women.\n\nThe fourth phase of the UN Women’s project Eid-bi-Eid supports the economic and social empowerment of the most vulnerable women. Beneficiaries include particularly the Syrian refugee women and the most vulnerable Jordanian women. The objective of the project is improve women’s rights, including livelihoods through: \n1)\tSecure livelihoods opportunities provided via cash for work that graduates into sustainable employment opportunities whether through job placement, entrepreneurship, or work permit applications\n2)\tGender based violence prevention, protection and awareness raising services\n3)\tEducation opportunities linked to the labor market, leadership, and civic engagement initiatives for women, while also engaging men on social issues related to gender equality and women’s empowerment\n\nThe EBE4 project covers 2023-2026 and it is a multi-donor pooled fund.

This project supports the participatory development of an electronic harmonized reproductive health registry (hRHR). This network is expected to link timely and accurate health data from local primary care health centres to hospital settings and governorate-level planning bodies, and then back to communities in the Mafraq governorate of Jordan. \n\nGiven the high number of Syrian refugees in the Mafraq governorate, the registry will be designed to serve both refugee and non-refugee populations to address the different health needs and social contexts of the various groups. More specifically, the project will analyze existing systems and tools of sexual and reproductive health data collection and use; develop a harmonized electronic registry system using participatory approaches and established guidelines from the World Health Organization; strengthen representation of underserved groups of women, men, and youth in stakeholder meetings and governance processes; develop a dashboard of data and related analysis; assess the quality, timeliness, and reliability of data; and build the capacities of researchers and decision-makers. \n\nThe main outcomes include improved quality and timeliness of reproductive health data, better integration and inter-operability among different health facilities, a strengthened referral system, increased capacities by decision-makers and providers to use health data, and costed plans to scale up the hRHR effort to other parts of the country.  \n\nThis project represents one of nine spanning two regions (West Africa and the Middle East) and two thematic topics (adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems). The project is closely aligned with the Government of Canada’s new Feminist International Assistance Policy, the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 WHO led Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development. It is being implemented by the Jordan-based Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network.', 'L’absence de données fiables limite la capacité des fournisseurs de soins, des planificateurs et des membres de la collectivité à prendre des décisions éclairées pouvant avoir une incidence sur le bien-être des femmes et des enfants, surtout dans les populations vulnérables et sous-représentées. Ce projet appuie l’établissement participatif d’un registre de santé reproductive normalisé électronique. Ce réseau devrait relier des données sur la santé précises et actuelles provenant de centres de soins de santé primaires avec des hôpitaux et des organismes de planification à l’échelle des gouvernorats; les données seront ensuite retransmises aux collectivités du gouvernorat de Mafraq, en Jordanie. \n\nÉtant donné le nombre élevé de réfugiés syriens se trouvant dans le gouvernorat de Mafraq, le registre sera conçu pour servir aux populations de réfugiés et aux populations non réfugiées afin de répondre aux différents besoins en santé et de tenir compte du contexte social des divers groupes. Le projet servira à analyser les systèmes et les outils de collecte et d’utilisation des données sur la santé sexuelle et reproductive; à établir un système de registre normalisé électronique à l’aide d’approches participatives et de directives établies par l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé; à renforcer la représentation des groupes mal desservis de femmes, d’hommes et de jeunes dans les réunions des parties prenantes et les processus de gouvernance; à établir un tableau de bord des données et des analyses connexes; à évaluer la qualité et la fiabilité des données; et à renforcer les capacités des chercheurs et des décideurs. \n\nLe projet aura principalement pour résultats une qualité et une exactitude accrues des données sur la santé, une meilleure intégration et interopérabilité des divers établissements de santé et un système de renvoi renforcé. \n\nCe projet est l’un de neuf projets s’étendant sur deux régions (l’Afrique de l’Ouest et le Moyen-Orient) et englobant deux thématiques (la santé sexuelle et reproductive des adolescents et les systèmes d’information sur la santé). Le projet est étroitement lié à la Politique d’aide internationale féministe du Canada, aux priorités stratégiques définies dans la Stratégie mondiale pour la santé de la femme, de l’enfant et de l’adolescent (2016-2030) menée par l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé, et au Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030.

The Centre for Accreditation and Quality Assurance and training providers will design/upgrade the curriculum and tests for at least three targeted occupations. Training providers will prepare test applicants on the job and in classroom, put them through the tests and retrain those who failed in order for them to be retested. Potential Jordanian and Syrian candidates will be recruited through field campaigns and job fairs, tested and referred to short-term skills upgrading programmes. Graduates will be placed mainly in the companies in which they undertook their training. 2. Training programme among cooperatives, placement agencies and other stakeholders are organized and rolled out with the aim to provide better services and improve working conditions. The establishment of placement agencies in particular will assist with the recruitment of Syrians and Jordanians, securing their work permits and placing them in construction companies. Currently no other agency is performing this task and the establishment of these agencies will be a new pilot innovation to inspire public-private partnerships to potentially take this role in the future. These organizations will implement the core services in the framework to be approved by the Ministry of Labour. Both placement agency and cooperatives will agree with each employer on specific plans related to improvement of work conditions, while at the same time providing technical expertise for improvement of productivity. The project also carries out awareness-raising campaigns towards refugees, employers and the host communities in order to improve understanding of labour rights and occupational safety and health, manage expectations of each group and prevent tensions. It will rely on this aspect on both traditional media and social media. 3. Joint business ventures are established between Syrian and Jordanians with the aim of providing them with the knowledge and skills to create their own business plan. Special attention is be paid to women’s participation in the programme. Practical challenges will be tackled with direct measures while cultural barriers will be tackled by direct interactions with their families to try to overcome them.']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],92e60416f92a8b43897eb404631b3bb3,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']",['Jordan'],['development'],"['United Kingdom, Foreign and Commonwealth Office']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],2025-06-04T09:20:27.816326

As part of the implementation of the Jordan Compact, the project seeks to devise mechanisms whereby Syrian refugees and Jordanians will be better matched with available jobs, have access to work permits, and benefit from decent wages and working conditions. Construction, confectionary and garment have been identified as priority sectors for the project due to the large number of Syrians already working informally and their inclusion as eligible sectors under the EU-Jordan trade agreement. Based on past work, it is clear that the sectors need models to ensure Syrian refugees and Jordanians are formally employed under decent work conditions that promote their full development potential. Skills training will be provided to help Syrian refugees and Jordanians develop and accredit demand-driven skills and thus support better job matching. Competency standards, curriculum and training materials will be created and upgraded in close collaboration with the Center for Accreditation and Quality Assurance (CAQA), the National Employment and Training (NET) Company and other training providers.

The targeting of vulnerable children will be undertaken in consultation with the ILO national survey currently being carried out by the Jordanian Strategic Centre for Studies and Research within the USDOL funded project. It focuses on both Syrian and Jordanian families. The project will aim also at reaching at least 300 families of the most vulnerable children working in WFCL in the hosting communities. Overall Objective: Reduce the number of working and dropout children among Syrian refugees and hosting communities through the provision of direct services. These services include educational, recreational, pre-vocational counseling and vocational training (See Annex 1 for details of Direct Services) Immediate Outcomes and Outputs Outcome 1:700 working children (25% girls), out of which 400 vulnerable children protected from early entry to labour market and 300 withdrawn from the WFCL. The project is expected to deliver the following measurable and sustainable results: 1. Sample based tracer study cases are organized with targeted children to identify the intervention with greater impact, and the best intervention model is documented for replication. 2. 400 vulnerable students will be prevented from dropping out of school. 3. 300 children involved in the WFCL will be provided with needed remedial services. 4. 700 parents will have their awareness raised regarding the OSH and WFCL and the importance of quality education as a long term investment and provided with socio-economical services through referral paths. 5. At least 100 school teachers and counsellors will have their capacity enhanced on how to prevent children from early drop out. 6. 1,000 of the children siblings and local communities will have their awareness raised on the negative impact of CL incorporating SCREAM modules who will act as advocates within their schools and local communities.']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],"['Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada', 'International Labour Organization (ILO)']",340fff26fa665bc5e75835639e028d10,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']",['Jordan'],"['humanitarian', 'development']","['Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],2025-06-04T09:22:40.412135

Despite high enrolment rates and access to schools throughout the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. Schools in remote areas suffer from insufficient access to electricity to operate daily services such as providing efficient heating and cooling systems within the classroom and connecting computers and online learning. Additionally, with an influx of Syrian refugees, institutions and services are overwhelmed with the increase of demands by an ever-growing population. This project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa’a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time. ABOUT THIS REPORT This quarterly report provides an overview of activities that took place during the fourth quarter of project implementation (April – June 2018). The Report covers the work carried out by Princess Alia Foundation (PAF), Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities (FPEC), Horizons for Green Development (Horizons) and the National Energy Research Center (NERC). THE TEAM PAF was founded by H.R.H Princess Alia Al Hussein and is registered under the Ministry of Social Development. The Foundation aims to promote compassion and respect for all livings beings, using a holistic approach and bringing different stakeholders together to bring forth change. FPEC is specialized in community empowerment through poverty reduction, community building, capacity development, awareness raising and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in the educational, environmental and social fields. FPEC’s target populations are those who are most vulnerable in society: women, youth, and other marginalized groups. Horizons works to develop a green environment and way of living within Jordan. Through civic engagement, socio-economic empowerment of vulnerable groups, awareness raising and capacity building within the environmental sector, Jordanian society can move towards become more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Following the first three quarters of project implementation, substantial progress had been made. With the roadmaps established and additional preparations made, the project team has moved forward with activity implementation. PAF continues to manage the project’s overall implementation, procurement and the lobbying and advocacy of the work.', 'Renewable energy and energy efficiency systems for the (100) schools To bring aboard companies to implement renewable energy systems, photovoltaic systems, also PV power systems or PV systems, which are designed to supply solar power by means of photovoltaics – or in simple terms, technologies which derive energy from the sun., These will be used to provide heating and cooling systems, lighting, and general maintenance in schools. Three tenders were released towards the end of February & June 2018. However, prior to the release of the tenders, it was necessary to coordinate with electricity companies to check the capacity of the electricity network to accommodate for the additional load and PV system to be installed in all schools. The results of the electricity network assessment study estimated a total cost of around JOD126,007, a number that would have set the project back but it is much lower than it was expected. However, through discussions held with the Ministry of Education, assistance from their end was offered and they paid the requested amount on the spot to the electricity company which facilitated the smooth release of the three tenders and facilitated the implementation of the project. Moreover, they paid all the suspended electricity bills for the (100) schools to further support our project. The first tender was released in February targeting 32 of the 100 schools that through the initial screening by electricity companied did not require electricity network upgrades. The tender specifically outlines the requirements of each company and the work that will be carried out. The deadline for bid submissions was on 22 April 2018. Received tenders were evaluated by qualified technical and financial committees consisting of qualified candidates from NERC, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Education and the Project Team. It was awarded on May 2018 and the contractor started the implementation aiming at finalizing and operating the 32 schools by December 2018. The second and third tenders for the remaining 68 schools have been released on April with a deadline on June 10, 2018. The received tenders have been evaluated technically and financially and it is expected to award the two contracts by Mid July 2018 so that they can finalize the implementation and operation of the remaining 68 schools by end of December 2018, early January 2019 at max which will keep the project schedule and work plan on track', 'AWARENESS WORKSHOPS AT LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL : Workshops focusing on social cohesion and renewable energy best practices continue to take place with the target audience being Syrian and Jordanian women. A total of 38 workshops, 19 renewable energy and climate change Workshops, and 19 social cohesion workshops were conducted targeting 1329 women and girls and 36 men and boys. Participants were equipped with new knowledge that will be dispersed amongst their communities. Half of these workshops were conducted in Ramtha and the remaining was conducted in Irbid. As the direct feedback and impressions from both of the participants and the CBOs in Ramtha were very positive, the same approach was followed in Irbid workshops. The pre and post surveys for Ramtha have been analyzed showing very positive progress and improvement in the participants’ gained knowledge as it is detailed in Annex I. Here are the main questions the improvement was as follow: 1. Do they know the difference between climate change and weather? The participants’ knowledge in this questions has been improved from 82% to 97% 2. What are the reasons behind the climate change? The participants’ knowledge in this questions has been improved from 11% to 37% 3. How to Reduce the Effect of Climate Change? The participants’ knowledge in this questions has been improved from 49% to 76% 4. What are the methods that could achieve Rationalization of Energy Consumption at the household level? The participants’ knowledge in this questions has been improved from 64% to 75% During this quarter, the team managed to complete the workshops in Ramtha and moved to Irbid to expand the benefit for the people there. The distribution of the participants is as follows: 548 participants in Ramtha, 611 in Bani Obaid and 170 participants in Qasbet Irbid. Although the focus in awareness was so far on women and girls due to their strong impact on their families and communities, FPEC is planning to include men and boys in the upcoming workshops to ensure more gender equality. The team is currently in the process of analyzing the pre and post surveys for the different areas to measure the gained knowledge and impact and come up with the results that will benefit the project in general. Additionally, two workshops for gender mainstreaming were conducted for the management board and selected youth through a center run by Youth without Borders (YWB). The workshops targeted 29 males and 11 females. Another workshop is planned for the Sareeh CBO in Irbid to take place in July. At the same time and in order to measure the gender mainstreaming in the targeted schools, FPEC in cooperation with Queen Rania Center have distributed gender questionnaires to a sample of 20 schools to be completed by school directors. This will help us determine their needs and design the trainings accordingly. We are planning to conduct gender training for teachers in August. TEACHERS & STUDENTS ACTIVITIES: With the list of 100 schools finalized, focal points and teachers from each school were selected, with assistance from the Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS). Focal points and teachers will remain in constant communication with the project team and will be participating in a training to gain further knowledge on climate change, the energy crisis in Jordan, best practices and tools for rationing energy use and reducing costs and CO2 emissions, and how to organize and implement team building activities between students from different backgrounds to ensure social cohesion and interaction. JREDS management of the 100 schools became official with the signing of a contract on 1 February 2018. Accordingly, three components were brought to life. The first is the Shammousa Manual, which will be distributed throughout the schools outlining all relevant information related to renewable energy and the environment. The second is the development of an interactive CD game (10,000) copies to be distributed throughout the 100 schools. The final component of the Educational Toolkit is the development of a Virtual Reality program to teach students about the environment and energy in an engaging way. These measures will fully engage students and introduce them to best practices on energy saving and to promote green culture. Visits to all 100 schools outlining the project and the activities have been completed. With the completion of the Shammousa Manual, the teacher’s TOT has been completed by JREDS during April and May 2018. Climate change and creation of environmental codes were provided as well as the establishment of environmental committees to discuss the best means of approaching the eco-school program. Trained teachers will commence the students training next semester once they return back from the summer holiday. An action plan has been developed to distribute the (10,000) interactive CDs to the students for next semester. Moving forward with the virtual reality software, one visit was made to one of the schools where students have experienced the virtual reality educational game which took them to a different world where they learnt how the RE is generated starting from space and ending in the electricity cable. Due to some technical difficulties during the use of the system, the project team has amended its action plan so that 2 schools are visited per day once the new semester commences. Moreover and in coordination with the Royal Marine Conservation Society of Jordan (JERDS), a mapping was conducted for summer camps in the northern governorates to investigate where there is a need to support those activities or gaps that our project can fill. We discovered that Makani, a UNCIEF program, has a number of activities in the area and the project team has contacted the focal point there to start the collaboration. We are currently in the process of preparing a concept note for the drop out of school program for Syrian refugee/Jordanian students in two locations in the northern governorates of Jordan. The objective of this is to provide Syrian/Jordanian student ages 6- 17 with catch-up lessons in Arabic, English, and math using community-based organizations as venues during the summer holiday. We are aiming at reintegrating the targeted students into the public school system for the next semester beginning in fall. We have selected two CBOs for now, in Mafraq and Ramtha. We will coordinate with our focal points to select teachers in the coming week, starting the 1st of July. We will target around 150 students. A website is in progress through a specialized media company in order to map out the location of schools that are currently receiving funds and/or assistance related to the environment or renewable energy and from whom. The map will also include schools that are in need of assistance to ensure there is no overlap amongst schools and donors who are interested in similar projects. The 100 selected schools have also been marked on Google Maps for future reference. The project team has visited Queen Rania Center for IT to explore possible cooperation channels as they are hosting all the servers responsible for the very detailed data for schools in the kingdom, their students and staff. It was agreed that the project will develop its own website for the schools equipped with RE&EE systems but the server will be hosted at Queen Rania Center to ensure more sustainability. The web site will be launched next quarter. As collaborations with JREDS continue to be productive, it was recommended by the Netherlands Embassy for the project team to reach out to Mercy Corps for a possible partnership. Mercy Corps implements similar projects and are also recipients of the same fund. A meeting was held on 20 February 2018 and proved to be fruitful. The conversation led to a partnership to be developed throughout different levels (schools, governance, and water) as the mandate of the team and Mercy Corps are very similar. An MOU has been signed by the two parties and follow-up technical meetings have taken place to discuss the logistics of creating this synergy CBOs ACTIVITIES: During the second quarter, 4 CBOs were selected to participate in the program. Socio-economic baseline studies were conducted for the 4 CBOs to evaluate their capacity, how to best use their respective skillset, and what possible small initiatives could take place. However, meetings were held with an additional two CBOs and it was recommended by the project team to replace one of the current CBOs as their capacity may not be at the expected level to carry out appropriate tasks. Cooperation agreements have been signed with the final selected 4 CBOs in April to start implementing the agreed upon small initiatives. So far, the activities in the 4 CBOs are progressing very well. Staff and focal points from each CBO have been selected and recruited for at least six-ten months which provided job opportunities for almost (12) youth (male and female). Main activities with the CBOs are: 1. Revolving funds for the local community to purchase RE&EE systems for their houses to reduce the electricity bills and reduce CO2 emissions through using mainly PV systems and solar heaters. 2. Launching exhibitions/shops fully equipped for selling RE/EE systems for the local community supported by the revolving funds mechanisms. 3. Coordinate with JREEEF which supports partially the installation of the PV systems and solar heaters so that the remaining value will be covered by the CBOs through the revolving fund mechanism. Our plan is to collaborate to make the process clear and more transparent for local communities in the northern governorates so this becomes a realistic option for them. 4. Equipping training halls to be used for training and awareness for local communities. These halls will be like a gathering hub for the local people to announce the provided services by the CBO for them under the project and to be used for different awareness events. So far, four workshops are planned targeting 200 youth (male and female) 5. Train the recruited CBO staff on doing the energy audit to be rolled-out for the local houses and commercial buildings. 6. Asses the CBOs needs and capacities to provide them with needed training and programs to ensure sustainability. VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTERS ACTIVITIES: Concerning progress made with the vocational training centers (VTCs), two meetings were held to discuss the project and the role they will play, the equipment needed to prepare the labs and the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Princess Alia Foundation (PAF) and the VTCs. As discussed in the meetings, youths participating in the training course at the VTCs will register through an assigned CBO, will receive a monthly stipend, transportation and meals. Participants will receive all relevant training material and will receive a professional practicing license and toolkit upon completion. The training course will last for 600 hours (4-6 months) with the training material to be developed in collaboration between the VTCs and a project consultant. So, an MOU was signed with the VTCs and three main centers in Mafraq, Irbid and Shouneh will be equipped with off-grid and on-grid PV systems for educational purposes. CBOs will be the connection channel for nominating youth to be trained in the VTCs. Adding this new training and career to the VTCs is a great asset for the government and for youth in general and for the project in particular as it will ensure the sustainability of this program and will open the door for the green jobs in Jordan on equal basis. The project team is currently in the process of developing materials for the training including a training manual. An announcement for the training will be made in the 1st week of July through the vocational training centers and social media. SOCIAL COHESION: It’s worth mentioning that the entire project team including the partner CBOs has ensured the inclusion of Syrian and Jordanian participants (male and female) on equal basis in all the above clarified activities so far especially in the awareness workshops which induce the behavioral changes of both Jordanians and Syrians to rationalize energy use, and induce social cohesion LOBBYING AND ADVOCACY ACTIVITIES: 1. Signing partnership MOUs with different parties mainly VTCs, Mercy Corps, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Social Development. 2. As previously discussed to set-up a central/general fund, where every school can allocate their energy savings/earnings in one location. This was agreed upon and supported by HRH through meetings and discussions held with the Ministry of Education. By equipping schools with RE&EE systems, they will be provided with free and clean energy for the next 25 years, allowing them to create a surplus of produced energy that can be sold to electricity companies and to transfer savings made to this trust fund. In addition, PAF will tackle carbon trade as the installed systems will reduce CO2 emissions by almost 5,000 tons annually. HRH has emphasized the importance of creating such a trust fund under the supervision of the Ministry of Education in order to utilize its savings to assist and improve the learning environment for other vulnerable schools. A proposal was sent accordingly to the Minister to be forwarded to the right channels 3. To study our project best options in regard to the CO2 credit in compliance with Jordan’s’ share and commitment, the project team has organized a meeting with the climate change department at Ministry of Environment. Also, a meeting was conducted with one of the accredited international organizations called UPM to draw the road map for this activity. So far, and as the price of one ton of carbon has been reduced to less than half a dollar internationally, the minster of environment is looking for other options to benefit from the installed PV systems especially that electricity company and large factories and investors are pushing Ministry of Environment to look and adopt a suitable solution. Our project is keeping a close follow up to benefit from the results. 4. Its worth mentioning that PAF has started this activity even before the actual start of the project. PAF managed to lobby for the inclusion of RE systems in building codes for any future school. Moreover, it is in the process of changing the current electricity tariff of the schools to a lower rate as they are currently paying a commercial tariff.']",['The Princess Alia Foundation'],['The Princess Alia Foundation'],7edb62462c9152e80d46c1a622f63303,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",['rural'],"['Jordan', 'Northern governorates', 'Mafraq', 'Ramtha', 'Irbid', 'North of Balqa’a Governorates']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Netherlands Embassy'],"['Princess Alia Foundation', 'Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development', 'National Energy Research Center', 'Royal Marine Conservation Society', 'Mercy Corps']",2025-06-04T09:23:07.400390

Improve the learning environment and reduce the present challenges in schools with high numbers of Syrian students at schools located in remote areas through providing them with a free source of needed electricity; renewable energy coupled with energy efficiency devices to operate various learning tools such as computers, access on-line curricula, sufficient lighting, cooling and heating systems to provide a safe and healthy learning environment and increase student retention. 2. Provide a sufficient sustainable income by savings in the electricity bills and by connecting these schools to the national grid enabling the sale of excess electricity generated. This additional income will be used for the daily maintenance of the system and the schools such as replacing broken windows, doors, painting, procuring educational resources and others. 3. Improve the livelihood of surrounding communities through creating new job opportunities for youth in the energy sector. They will be trained by the RE private sector and at least 10% will be hired to ensure the sustainability of the systems. 4. Empower the role of women CBOs in the targeted areas as training centers for local youth in the field of installing and maintaining Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems. 5. Promote the social cohesion and community solidity between the Syrian refugees and hosting communities.', 'Renewable energy and energy efficiency systems for the (100) schools. As mentioned in previous reports, three companies are awarded to install RE and PV systems for providing heating and cooling equipment, lighting and maintenance to the (100) selected schools. Support rendered by the Ministry of Education to this particular project made it possible to pay an outstanding balance identified in a concluded electric survey (JOD 126.007) due to the Electric Company. While this amount could have severely influenced available budget, demonstrated MoE support made it possible that suppliers proceed with schedule as initially planned. The MoE also paid the accumulated electricity bills on behalf of all identified 100. It is expected that the work of these companies at the selected schools will be completed by Dec 2018/January 2019. This directly benefits 41,406 Jordanian and Syrian students of which 17,145 boys (%41) and 24,261 girls (%59). AWARENESS WORKSHOPS IN COMMUNITIES: Host communities are actively engaged in conducting awareness workshops in cooperation with women CBOs. Thematic topics address social cohesion and best practices on renewable energy targeting Syrian and Jordanian women who will in return dispersed awareness to their respective communities. So far, the project managed to conduct 80 workshops in Ramtha, Irbid, and North Shouneh (40 days on social cohesion and 40 days on energy awareness). The workshops will be next rolled out in Mafraq’s different villages. Evaluating the pre and post surveys proved the gained knowledge and the shifted positive approach of 3,011 people: 2,640 women (1,777 Jordanians and 863 Syrians) and 371 men (252 Jordanians and 119 Syrians). As the preliminary direct feedback and impressions from both of the participants and the CBOs in Ramtha were very positive, the same approach was adopted in Irbid and North Shouneh workshops. Here are examples of questions that show the improvement in gained knowledge of participants after attending the awareness session: 1. Do you know the difference between climate change and weather? The participants’ knowledge in this questions was improved from 82% to 97% 2. What are the reasons of climate change? The participants’ knowledge in this question is improved from 11% to 37% 3. How to Reduce the Effect of Climate Change? Participants’ knowledge in this question was improved from 49% to 76% 4. What are the methods that could achieve Rationalization of Energy Consumption at the household level? Participants’ knowledge to this questions was improved from 64% to 75% . TEACHERS & STUDENTS ACTIVITIES: 1. The 100 selected schools profited further through their inclusion in the Eco-Schools program; where an international certified body is teaching students how to be active in changing others actions by rationalizing energy use through following best practices. Focal points and teachers from each school were selected, with assistance from the Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS). Focal points and teachers will remain in constant communication with the project team and will be participating in a training to gain further knowledge on climate change, energy challenges in Jordan, best practices and tools for rationing energy use and reducing costs and CO2 emissions, and how to organize and implement team building activities between students from different backgrounds to ensure social cohesion and interaction. JREDS management of the 100 schools became official with the signing of a contract on 1 February 2018. So far, JREDS managed to complete the TOT for 200 teachers (125 females and 75 males). This enhanced extra-curricular activities in these schools. 2. In consequence, three components are brought to life; Shammousa Manual, distributed to schools outlining all relevant information related to renewable energy and the environment, development and distribution of (10,000) copies of an interactive CD game to the 100 schools, and the Educational Toolkit which is developing of a Virtual Reality program to teach students about the environment and energy in an engaging way. These measures will fully engage students and introduce them to best practices on energy saving and to promote green culture. Students participated in an interactive virtual reality video that takes viewers on a dream like journey through space to better understand the operation of PV systems demonstrating how energy is generated and saved. So far 1,434 students experienced the video. 3. A website is in progress through a specialized media company in order to map out the location of schools that are currently receiving funds and/or assistance related to environment or renewable energy and by whom. The map will also include schools that are in need of assistance to ensure there is neither schools overlap nor donors prioritizing similar projects. The 100 selected schools have also been marked on Google Maps for future reference. The project team visited Queen Rania Center for IT to explore possible cooperation channels as they are hosting all the servers responsible for the very detailed data for schools in the Kingdom, their students and staff. It was agreed that the project will develop its own website for the schools equipped with RE&EE systems but the server will be hosted at Queen Rania Center to ensure more sustainability. The website is almost ready and expected to be launched soon. CBOs ACTIVITIES: During the second quarter, 4 CBOs were selected to participate in the program. Socio-economic baseline studies were conducted for the 4 CBOs to evaluate their capacity, how to best use their respective skillset, and potential small initiatives which could take place. Cooperation agreements are signed with the final selected 4 CBOs in April to start implementing the agreed upon small initiatives. A fifth CBO was selected at a later stage to expand the benefits based on positive results. The engagement of women CBOs is further deepened by equipping the selected CBOs with exhibitions that provide citizens with RE & EE systems through revolving funds, or through networking with local support initiatives such as JREEEF. The project has equipped these exhibitions with trained 15 local youth who are keen to raise awareness in the community and encourage them to adopt best practices through conducting the energy audits at a household level. These CBOs are equipped with proper training halls that are used as a hub for the local community to promote green culture. Thus far, more than 20 families have benefited from these services which are mainly: 1. Revolving funds for the local community to purchase RE&EE systems for their houses to reduce the electricity bills and reduce CO2 emissions by using mainly PV systems and solar heaters. 2. Launching exhibitions/shops fully equipped for selling RE/EE systems for the local community supported by the revolving funds mechanisms. 3. Coordinate with JREEEF which supports partially the installation of the PV systems and solar heaters so that the remaining value will be covered by the CBOs through the revolving fund mechanism. Our plan is to collaborate to make the process clear and more transparent for local communities in the northern governorates so this becomes a realistic option for them. 4. Equipping training halls to be used for training and awareness for local communities. These halls will be like a gathering hub for the local people to announce the provided services by the CBO for them under the project and to be used for different awareness events. So far, four workshops are conducted which targeted 200 youth (male and female). 5. Train the recruited CBO staff on doing the energy audit to be rolled-out for the local houses and commercial buildings. 6. Asses CBOs needs and capacities to provide them with needed training and programs to ensure sustainability. VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTERS ACTIVITIES: To sustain efforts of creating green jobs, and following the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Princess Alia Foundation (PAF) and the VTCs, the project has equipped three of the main vocational training centers with on-grid and off-grid educational PV systems. They were also provided with comprehensive TOT that is crucial in order to teach youth how to install and maintain the RE & EE systems and expand the benefits for all communities. An announcement was posted to attract interested youth to apply for the training through filing a specific application. The project team is in the process of reviewing the received applications to select the potential youth (males and females) to join the training. Youth participating in the training course at the VTCs will receive a monthly stipend, transportation and meals. Participants will receive all relevant training material and will receive a professional practicing license and toolkit upon completion. The training course will last 600 hours (4-6 months) with the training material to be developed in collaboration between the VTCs and a project consultant. SOCIAL COHESION: It is worth mentioning that the entire project team including the partner CBOs has ensured the inclusion of Syrian and Jordanian participants (male and female) on equal basis in all the above clarified activities so far especially in the awareness workshops which induce the behavioral changes of both Jordanians and Syrians to rationalize energy use and induce social cohesion. LOBBYING AND ADVOCACY ACTIVITIES: 1. Signing partnership MOUs with different parties mainly VTCs, Mercy Corps, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social Development. 2. As previously discussed to set-up a central/general fund, where every school can allocate their energy savings/earnings in one location. This was agreed upon and supported by HRH through meetings and discussions held with the Ministry of Education. By equipping schools with RE&EE systems, they will be provided with free and clean energy for the next 25 years, allowing them to create a surplus of produced energy that can be sold to electricity companies and to transfer savings made to this trust fund. In addition, PAF will tackle carbon trade as the installed systems will reduce CO2 emissions by almost 5,000 tons annually. A proposal was sent accordingly to the Minister to be forwarded to the right channels. The project team is planning to recruit a specialized advocacy team of lawyers in order to follow this matter with Parliament. 3. The project is still in discussion with Ministry of Environment to study our project’s best options with regard to CO2 credit in compliance with Jordan’s’ share and commitment. So far, and as the price of one ton of carbon is reduced to less than half a dollar internationally, the Minister of Environment is looking for other options to benefit from the installed PV systems especially that the electricity company and big factories and investors are pushing the Ministry of Environment to look and adopt a suitable solution. 4. PAF has managed to lobby for the inclusion of RE systems in building codes for future schools. Moreover, it is in the process of changing the current school electricity tariffs to a lower rate as they are currently being charged with a commercial tariff.']",['The Princess Alia Foundation'],['The Princess Alia Foundation'],f3e37e8d6adff3738a8501b3fffc4e00,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['rural', 'urban']","['Jordan', 'Mafraq', 'Ramtha', 'Irbid', 'North of Balqa’a Governorates', 'North Shouneh']","['humanitarian', 'development']",[],"['Princess Alia Foundation', 'Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development', 'National Energy Research Center', 'Royal Marine Conservation Society', 'JREDS']",2025-06-04T09:23:07.662666

A country with few natural resources, Jordan looks to its human resources as the key element for its success in the markets of the region, and the prosperity, health, and security of its people. The country envisions a population of responsible, self-confident, and innovative learners. The ability of the educational system to develop and nurture creativity and innovation among learners will be a cornerstone that contributes to the development of a knowledge economy in Jordan. Despite the very high enrollment rates and the availability of access to schools across the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. The average achievement in urban areas is higher than that in the rural and more remote areas. One of the major challenges of the Ministry of Education is to provide the schools with the required budget to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum learning in all schools across the Kingdom. The schools in remote areas lack sufficient electricity to operate daily services such as providing efficient heating and cooling systems within the classrooms lighting the classrooms, connecting computers and online learning, in extreme temperatures and lack of sufficient financial resources to improve the schools’ environment. A further challenge is, the large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan, since 2011 has increased the load on the Kingdom’s already limited resources. Jordan hosts 1.5 million Syrians, 655,365 are refugees . The country in general, and its northern communities in particular, have come under severe stress as institutions and services are overwhelmed with the increasing demands placed upon them by the growing population. Key drivers of tension between the hosting communities and the refugees at the micro-level are safeguarding livelihoods and competition for income-generating opportunities; the struggle to find adequate, affordable housing; and challenges in the education sector such as difficulty in accessing education and a deteriorating learning environment. These drivers of tension are also prevalent on the macro-level . Jordan’s generous provision of free access to public schools to Syrian children has also increased the pressure on primary schools in intake areas. This in turn poses challenges to ensuring a healthy learning environment, and has stoked inter-communal tension in some towns where Jordanians see Syrian refugees as increasing class sizes, and straining school resources. Some Jordanians who had enrolled their children in private schools but could not continue to send them for financial reasons reportedly found nearby public schools were full due to increased Syrian enrollment further compounding the social tension between the host communities and the Syrian refugees. The link between education and poverty is a complex yet highly interdependent issue where education can be a driving factor in pulling families out of the cycle of poverty. Providing education will reduce the risks of early marriage and military recruitment of children, stabilize economic futures by increasing earning potential, and ensure that today’s youth will be better equipped to confront their uncertain futures. Moreover, the Syrian crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than ever. The Government of Jordan has made progress in this regard, through a National Energy Strategy, currently under implementation, and the adoption, in 2012, of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Law, that provides incentives for sustainable energy solutions. A priority is to achieve local energy production, mainly by scaling-up renewable energy initiatives and improving energy efficiency across the board. This project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa’a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time.', 'Deliverables Description: 1.1 A clean source of energy is provided for the selected schools 1.1.1 The project contracted the National Energy Research Centre (NERC) in order to assess the current electricity consumption at the selected 100 schools and specify the needed PV systems, heating and cooling systems and lighting systems to reduce the electricity bills to almost zero and improve the learning environment at the same time. The (100) schools were selected at the northern governorates in cooperation with Ministry of Education based on certain selection criteria such as the value of electricity bills, overcrowding, poverty, number of Syrian students, elementary schools and number of teaching shifts. 1.1.2 Accordingly, three tenders were released and evaluated through an evaluation committee that gathered NERC, Ministry of Education (MoE) and Ministry of Public works. The three tenders were awarded on May and July 2017 and the work is in progress for the 100 schools. Support rendered by the Ministry of Education to this particular project made it possible to pay an outstanding balance identified in a concluded electric survey (JOD 126,007.0) due to the Electric Company. While this amount could have severely influenced available budget, MoE support made it possible that suppliers proceeded with the schedule as initially planned. 1.1.3 Several lessons learned can be documented from this experience. An important one is the necessity of schools’ roofs inspection before moving ahead with installing the PV systems or even the selection of the school in the first place. An agreement was signed with The Royal Scientific Society (RSS)/Buildings department in order to supervise the inspection of the selected schools’ roofs. When the roofs were inspected through laboratory testing, it was found that some of the schools’ buildings’ were week and can’t handle the new PV systems especially if we added the wind force and other weather factors. Some of the schools are 70 years old. Therefore, PAF’s team in cooperation with RSS’s team and the Ministry of education has extensive site visits to the northern governorates to select 19 new schools that are less than 20 years old and have similar capacities to the replaced ones. These schools have to go through NERC’s assessment in order to specify the required heating/cooling systems and PV capacities. An amendment to NECR agreement was crucial in this case to ensure proper technical supervision. 1.1.4 Currently, the Ministry of Renewable Energy has included the roofs’ inspection as a requirement and perquisite for installing the PV systems to ensure the safety of students and sustainability of the installed systems. So far, 51 schools have been equipped with PV systems, heating/cooling systems, 30 are under RESS/NERC approval and process, and the remaining 19 schools have been selected and will go through NERC’s assessment to specify the needed systems capacities. 1.1.5 The project activities have crossed with the activities of another project which is the National Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (NAJMAH). This project focuses on improving the living conditions of Syrians and Jordanians through employing them in the maintenance activities of schools. This has interfered with the maintenance activities of our contractors. In order to maximize the benefit, the project decided to leave the schools maintenance for NJAMAH and utilize the saved money to benefit other schools. 1.1.6 According to the above clarified new requirements, it is expected that the work at the 100 schools will be completed by April 30 2019. This will directly benefit 48,351 Jordanian and Syrian students of which are 20,662 boys and 27,689 girls, 39,496 are Jordanian students while 8,855 are Syrians. 1.2 Improve learning environment at the selected schools: 1.2.1 The 100 selected schools profited further through their inclusion in the Eco-Schools program; where an international certified body is teaching students how to be active in changing others actions by rationalizing energy use through following best practices. Focal points and teachers from each school were selected, with assistance from the Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS). Focal points and teachers will remain in constant communication with the project team and they have participated in a training to gain further knowledge on climate change, energy challenges in Jordan, best practices and tools for rationing energy use and reducing costs and CO2 emissions as well as how to organize and implement team building activities between students from different backgrounds to ensure social cohesion and interaction. 1.2.2 So far, JREDS managed to complete the following; - The international Eco-Schools program was introduced to 100 schools. - TOT for 200 teachers (125 females and 75 males). - (9) Focal points volunteers appointed to follow up on activities in all selected schools. - (3,127) students were educated through the Eco-schools program. - Ran capacity building programs for the hired staff regarding action plan development, eco-schools and Shamouseh. - Printed and distributed promotional stickers in the “Turn off and save” (Tafeha o benhawesh) energy saving program across targeted schools. - Awareness campaign was launched via media outlets; Facebook, the press, e-letters and interviews organized to promote effective energy practices. 1.2.3 In so doing, three components were brought to life; Shammousa Manual, distributed to schools outlining all relevant information related to renewable energy and the environment, development and distribution of (10,000) copies of an interactive CD game to the 100 schools, and the Educational Toolkit which was developed for a Virtual Reality program. 1.2.4 The Virtual Reality educational screening was developed in parallel with the Eco-schools program to create a live experience for students about RE/EE and to teach them about the environment and energy in an engaging approach. These measures have fully engaged students and introduced them to best practices on energy saving and promoted green culture. Students participated in an interactive virtual reality video that takes viewers on a dream like journey through space to better understand the operation of PV systems demonstrating how energy is generated and saved. So far (3,127) students experienced the video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jHP5YmgZXs&feature=youtu.be 1.2.5 To further support the awareness among students that are younger in age, an interactive song is under development which will be broadcasted on famous children channels to reach out to the largest possible number of children. 1.2.6 A website was developed through a specialized media company in order to map out the location of schools that are currently receiving funds and/or assistance related to environment or renewable energy and by whom. The map will also include schools that are in need of assistance in order to ensure no overlapping of schools or donors prioritizing similar projects. The 100 selected schools have also been marked on Google Maps for future reference. The project team visited Queen Rania Center for IT (QRCIT) to explore possible cooperation channels, QRCIT host all the servers responsible for the schools’ data for in the Kingdom, their students and staff. It was agreed that the project will develop its own website for the schools equipped with RE&EE systems but the server will be hosted by the Queen Rania Center to ensure more sustainability. The first draft of the website is launched. http://solarjordanschools.com/ 1.2.7 Remedial classes and drop out of schools The project in cooperation with the local CBO’s have organized Summer remedial classes supported in the northern governorates, targeting Jordanian and Syrian students. Arabic, English and math lessons targeted out of school children, enabling them to apply for placement tests. A further professional program was developed in cooperation with “Youth Without Borders” CBO who are very active in Ramtha and one of the project CBO’s. They are going to cooperate with the Ministry of Education to attract 100 students who left school; those 100 students will be able to attend remedial classes over a three month time period and will then be enrolled back in schools. So far, 500 students have benefited from this program: 276 boys (96 Jordanians and 180 Syrians) and 224 girls (101 Jordanians and 123 Syrian). 1.3 Awareness Workshops In Communities: 1.3.1 Outside the school sphere, the project has completed a CBO mapping activity where (60) CBO’s were visited and assessed by our team. Almost (10-15) CBO’s were selected for the awareness activities while four CBO’s have been selected to further enhance the local green initiatives and employment. 1.3.2 The host communities are actively engaged in conducting awareness workshops in cooperation with the selected women CBO’s. Thematic topics address social cohesion and best practices on renewable energy that target Syrian and Jordanian women who will in turn spread awareness to their respective communities. In 2018, the project managed to conduct 100 workshops in Ramtha, Irbid, Mafraq and North Shouneh (50 days on social cohesion and 50 days on energy awareness). 1.3.3 Evaluating the pre and post surveys demonstrated the knowledge gained and the new positive attitude of 3,974 people of which are: 3,182 women and 792 men (2,854 Jordanians and 1,120 Syrians). 1.4 The role of women-led CBO’s in empowering women, reducing poverty and promoting the green culture in the surrounding communities 1.4.1 Forged partnership with four women CBO’s were established; in Mafraq, Ramtha, Sareeh/Irbid and the Jordan Valley, to develop their organizational and service minded skills for their communities. Women and youth employment is embedded within the activities through small income generating projects and the introduction of RE&EE technologies in close partnership of the private sector: - Two energy shops were created and equipped to showcase renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. The showrooms are managed by women CBO’s and employ youth from the local community. - Revolving funds for the local community to purchase RE&EE systems for their houses in order to reduce their electricity bills and reduce CO2 emissions by mainly using PV systems and solar heaters. So far, more than 50 families have benefited from the provided services such as solar heaters, AC’s that save energy as well as other systems that have reduced their energy bills. - Coordinated with JREEEF who partially support the installation of the PV systems and solar heaters so that the remaining value will be covered by the CBO’s through the revolving fund mechanism. Our plan is to collaborate and make the process clear and more transparent for local communities in the northern governorates therefore becoming a realistic option for them. - Youth trained on RE&EE and teams run energy audits in their communities, raising awareness and promoting the added value when adopting those technologies. The teams are working in different environments and can tailor required equipment for each setting. - These initiatives have managed to employ 15 youths both male and female from the local communities. - The honey production project was launched, women were trained and a showroom was built to market the products. - To ensure synergies in different programs, one CBO was supported with a solar pump in an existing water purification plant. The plant now runs a full eco-system. - Equipped training halls were and will be used for training and awareness for the local communities. These halls will act like a hub for the local community members, to announce the CBO’s available services under the project as well as be used for different renewable energy and energy efficiency awareness events. So far, four workshops were conducted which targeted 500 citizens (male and female). - Linkages between the CBO’s and the local authorities are formed for future cooperation and support. - The CBO’s premises are maintained and equipped with necessary furniture and equipment in order to improve services and to ensure consistent income generation by renting out the facilities. 1.4.2 The above small initiatives have proved their success and the positive impact in terms of youth capacity building, employment and long standing green business models. Thus, the project has decided to benefit an additional CBO in Mafraq (making it the fifth) in order to expand the benefits to additional communities. 1.4.3 Forged cooperation and support with other projects that are funded by the Dutch Ministry such as the hydroponic agriculture that is implemented by Eco-Consult Company. Our project has provided one of our CBO’s with off-grid PV system for the Hydroponic unit provided by Eco-Consult to reduce their energy bill by 100% from JOD 300.0 to Zero. 1.5 Vocational Training Centers (VTC’s) 1.5.1 To sustain the green job’s creation efforts, and by following the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Princess Alia Foundation (PAF) and the VTC’s, the project has equipped three of the main vocational training centers with on-grid and off-grid educational PV systems. - A one-week ToT session was organized by the EU TA II program manager for 5 teachers. The ToT was crucial in order for the teachers to impart to youth how to install and maintain the RE & EE systems and expand the benefits for all communities. - Energy curriculum training material was developed (in cooperation with the EU) where 250 copies were printed and distributed to VTC’s. - Photo-voltaic education simulators (on/off grids) were installed in 3 VTC’s in the northern governorates; Irbid, Jordan Valley and Mafraq. - Educational tool kits were developed and will be distributed to graduates. - 100 students; 40 females and 60 males, enrolled in a 6 month RE&EE VTC training program. Graduates shall receive a ‘skilled’ level diploma. 1.5.2 The Employment Application is under process, it will become a platform that connects the trained youth and possible employers. This application will be open to all in order to facilitate job opportunities. 1.6 Lobbying and Advocacy 1.6.1 Signing partnership MOU’s with different parties; VTC’s, Mercy Corps, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Development to ensure their cooperation and support for the project. 1.6.2 PAF has managed to lobby for the inclusion of RE systems in building codes for future schools. Furthermore, it is in the process of changing the current school electricity tariffs to a lower rate as they are currently being charged with a commercial tariff (which is the highest). 1.6.3 The project has signed two contracts with two different experienced consultants. The first consultant will follow the establishment and set-up of a central/general fund, where every school can allocate their energy savings/earnings in one location. By equipping schools with RE&EE systems, they will be provided with free and clean energy for the next 25 years, allowing them to create a surplus of produced energy that can be sold to electricity companies and to transfer savings made to this trust fund. As a start, this was agreed upon and supported by HRH Princess Alia through meetings and discussions held with the Ministry of Education. They assigned two consultant one will follow through with meeting with the relevant stakeholders. 1.6.4 The second consultant will tackle the carbon trade mechanism in cooperation with the Ministry of environment as the installed systems will reduce CO2 emissions by almost 5,000 tons annually. The consultant will follow this matter with the Parliament. This will be a valuable opportunity that is applauded by the Ministry of Environment as Carbon Trade has been on hold for some time and there is a need to re-activate this topic and look for new mechanisms that are in the best interests of Jordan.', '3) Are the target group engaged in the implementation of the project? Yes, Intensively. Please elaborate: - The intensive awareness workshops for the local communities surrounding the schools had mobilized the community to be part of the project activities and they are actively inquiring on educational courses to get better understanding on available technology and means of energy savings. - Introduce the revolving fund model at CBO’s to ease the economic burden: participating associations engaged in managing fund creation and operation. Once active, community members are sensitized on process and began applying for interest-free loans to finance renewable energy technologies at homes, shops and farms with confidence in the investment made and revenue on the longer term. - Renewable energy showrooms are established and illustrate RE technologies: shops display renewable energy products that the community members can purchase through an interest-free payment system, they have started utilizing the educational material in the shops to learn more on RE and EE. - CBO energy audit teams: recruited focal points and volunteers trained and tasked with energy audits are actively promoting the audit exercise, sensitizing community and illustrating saved electricity bill amounts after installing RE technology. - Community members gain confidence in RE concept and accrued savings, community members approached CBO’s to request audits at their homes and businesses and started apply for revolving fund loans. - RE&EE education and certification: youth in communities enrol in training module at the local vocational training centres to qualify for future green jobs. Due to the introduction of practical and theoretical training some post-graduate students are also enrolled. - Eco-school programs: students and teachers are enthusiastically participating in responsible energy practices and are holding science fairs and organizing events to celebrate achievements. As a result, schools falling out of the targeted lists in communities are expressing interest in participating in similar activities. - Parents-teachers councils were created in targeted schools to organize additional awareness sessions in communities while environment clubs were created and became part of the school system. - The remedial classes for students who dropped-out of school and their support in enrolment after the three month period of classes have ended. - The close cooperation with relevant stakeholders such as the VTC’s, Parliament, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Environment. 4) Are the envisaged aims and results of the activity realised? Yes. To what extent? satisfactory Elaboration: Most outputs have been completed or are running on schedule without delays in agreement with the set timeline. Qualitative indicators: - Introduced an innovative activity; virtual reality, to students in 5th and 6th grade proved to be significantly impressive for the learning experience. Particularly for RE&EE. The model could effectively provide an impactful experience to children in common settings where traditional means of education dominates the learning experience; (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jHP5YmgZXs) - Eco-Schools is the largest international school program promoting sustainability – the program starts in the classroom and expands to the community by engaging generations in action-based learning. Through this program, young people experience a sense of achievement at being able to have a say in the environmental management policies of their schools, ultimately steering them towards certification and the status associated with the Green Flag award. - Established environmental clubs and committees in schools (15 to 20 students aged 10-15) which support the creation of local change agents promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency practices. - Teachers are empowered to organize awareness sessions and diverse initiatives through a participatory approach with students and have created local councils. - Income generating projects supported employment in communities, provide skillsets to beneficiaries and work on improving standard of living for families. - Provided solar powered water purification systems and logistical equipment and allow local groups to benefit from these systems by reinvesting profits into their communities. - Empowered CBO’s to better serve communities and promote RE&EE technologies through different models; revolving fund, awareness sessions and energy audit exercises. - Connected CBO’s with local authorities to eliminate bureaucratic barriers and create partnerships. - Established energy shops that are managed and run by CBO’s. - Supplied targeted VTC’s with necessary manuals on RE&EE, these were used to train community members, men and women, Syrians and Jordanians, on installation and maintenance. - Established an energy audit team to provide audits for households, farms and local private companies. In the 5 CBO’s a total of 15 volunteers are involved. These energy audits help community members understand their energy spending habits and patterns to modify them in order to reduce energy bills and raise awareness. - Promoted RE&EE in a local youth conference; the Arab Noor Conference, on supporting local businesses and young entrepreneurs.

The project managed to record several success stories in the year 2018. These in brief are as follow: 1. VTC’s centers supported by the project are now certified to train and provide youth with training and certification on installing and maintaining the PV systems, which is a new training for the VTC’s and a promising career opportunity in Jordan. Moreover, these centers have attracted women and girls to this new career opportunity and the VTC’s will graduate nearly 40 professional certified females. 2. The organized remedial classes have helped more than 200 kids to enroll back in their schools in order to continue with their academic endeavors. 3. The interactive educational tools such as the Eco-schools program and Virtual Reality experience have further profited the schools and students and encouraged them to adopt the green culture and best practices. 4. The established RE/EE shops and productive initiatives in the CBO’s have trained and employed almost 15 youth (males and females), built their capacities in a new career opportunity, improved their socio-economic conditions and reduced unemployment in these communities. Simultaneously, these shops have benefited more than 50 families and helped reduced their energy bills by more than 50%. 5. The collaborative efforts of the project team and the CBO’s have enabled the CBO’s to reach out to more than 500 citizens, improved their knowledge and taught them how to reduce their energy bills through energy audit and through adopting best practices in their houses']",['The Princess Alia Foundation'],"['The Princess Alia Foundation', 'Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Future Pioneers fo Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development']",9a2cf6ed79586f70573986c96cdccba9,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Jordan', 'Mafraq', 'Ramtha', 'Irbid', 'Balqa’a']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs'],"['The Princess Alia Foundation', 'Future Pioneers fo Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development']",2025-06-04T09:23:07.469703

The contractors were given July 15 as a deadline to handover all their schools. By June 30, more than (81) schools out of (100) have been equipped with PV systems, heating/cooling systems, LED lighting. The maintenance for the (100) schools have been completed. The remaining (19) schools will be completed by July 15, 2019. 1.1.2 The project have utilized the savings to equip five additional schools that have PV Systems through one of PAF previous projects with heating/cooling systems especially the ones in Jordan Valley in order to improve the learning environment there. 1.1.3 As the (105) schools will be completed and handed over by July 15, 2019, this will directly benefit more than 48,351 Jordanian and Syrian students of which are 20,662 boys and 27,689 girls, 39,496 are Jordanian students while 8,855 are Syrians. 1.1.4 In order to celebrate this success, a public event took place in one of the completed schools in North Shouneh on April 29, 2019 under the patronage of HRH Princess Alia Al-Hussien and the Netherlands Embassy. The event gathered the community leaders, relevant stakeholders, local authorities, VTC trainees, teachers and students and local CBOs. The event included clarifying the project achievements and the graduation of the VTC trainees in Al-Mashareh Center. Moreover, there was announcements for the different activities completed in Shouneh Women CBO which is one of the CBOs supported by the project and marketing for their honey products. 1.2 Improve learning environment at the selected schools: 1.2.1 The Eco-Schools program has been completed in the remaining schools and covered the targeted 100 schools. An international certified body is teaching students how to be active in changing others actions by rationalizing energy use through following best practices. Focal points and teachers from each school were selected, with assistance from the Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS). Focal points and teachers will remain in constant communication with the project team and they have participated in a training to gain further knowledge on climate change, energy challenges in Jordan, best practices and tools for rationing energy use and reducing costs and CO2 emissions as well as how to organize and implement team building activities between students from different backgrounds to ensure social cohesion and interaction. The project has conducted the post survey for the schools to measure the progress and achievements and completed the final evaluation. (46) Schools out of (100) have won the international eco-schools certification and a celebration event to honor these schools has been conducted on April 17, 2019. 1.2.2 The Virtual Reality educational screening was rolled out to the (100) schools. It was developed in parallel with the Eco-schools program to create a live experience for students about RE/EE and to teach them about the environment and energy in an engaging approach. These measures have fully engaged students and introduced them to best practices on energy saving and promoted green culture. Students participated in an interactive virtual reality video that takes viewers on a dream like journey through space to better understand the operation of PV systems demonstrating how energy is generated and saved. So far (3,127) students experienced the video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jHP5YmgZXs&feature=youtu.be 1.2.3 To further support the awareness among students that are younger in age, an interactive song has been developed and will be broadcasted on famous children channels to reach out to the largest possible number of children. 1.2.4 A website was developed through a specialized media company in order to map out the location of schools that are currently receiving funds and/or assistance related to environment or renewable energy and by whom in order to ensure no overlapping of schools or donors prioritizing similar projects. The 100 selected schools have also been marked on Google Maps for future reference. The project team is cooperating with other Donors to allocate the schools that they supported on the google map. The website is launched here. http://solarjordanschools.com/ 1.3 Awareness Workshops In Communities: 1.3.1 The project managed to complete the (100) awareness workshops for the communities surrounding the selected schools. Thematic topics address social cohesion and best practices on renewable energy that target Syrian and Jordanian women who will in turn spread awareness to their respective communities. In 2018, the project managed to conduct 100 workshops in Ramtha, Irbid, Mafraq and North Shouneh (50 days on social cohesion and 50 days on energy awareness). Evaluating the pre and post surveys demonstrated the knowledge gained and the new positive attitude of 3,974 people of which are: 3,182 women and 792 men (2,854 Jordanians and 1,120 Syrians). 1.4 The role of women-led CBO’s in empowering women, reducing poverty and promoting the green culture in the surrounding communities 1.4.1 Forged partnership with five women CBO’s were established; in Mafraq, Ramtha, Sareeh/Irbid and the Jordan Valley, to develop their organizational and service minded skills for their communities. Women and youth employment is embedded within the activities through small income generating projects and the introduction of RE&EE technologies in close partnership of the private sector. 1.4.2 The progress of the activities in these CBOs is going very well benefiting the local communities while employing more than (15) local youth. Awareness and audit activities have reached out to more than 1,500 citizens who encouraged the people to have revolving funds to purchase RE&EE systems for their houses in order to reduce their electricity bills and reduce CO2 emissions by mainly using PV systems and solar heaters. So far, more than 120 families have benefited from the provided services such as solar heaters, PV systems, AC’s that save energy as well as other systems that have reduced their energy bills. 1.4.3 The equipped two RE/EE exhibitions have proved a successful business model where the exhibition will be able to sustain after the project completion. 1.4.4 Forged cooperation and support with other projects that are funded by the Dutch Ministry such as the hydroponic agriculture that is implemented by Eco-Consult Company. Our project has provided one of our CBO’s with off-grid PV system for the Hydroponic unit provided by Eco-Consult to reduce their energy bill by 100% from JOD 300.0 to Zero. 1.4.5 Another PV system was provided to Mafraq CBO that has a small plastic house that plant organic products. 1.5 Vocational Training Centers (VTC’s) 1.5.1 The six months training course for the (120) youth was completed successfully and the trainees passed the needed certification exams and received a ‘skilled’ level diploma. An official graduation took place during a public event on April 29, 2019 under the patronage of HRH Princess Alia Al-Hussien. 1.5.2 The equipped VTCs should be able to sustain after the project completion as it is equipped with all needed PV systems, tools and training materials, and the new certified green job became well known in their area. So, after the project completion, this certification will be opened for the youth with certain fees like the other certifications in the VTC centers. 1.5.3 The Employment Application is completed and launched. It will be a platform that connects the trained youth and possible employers. This application will be open to all in order to facilitate job opportunities. 1.6 Lobbying and Advocacy There were three paths followed in order to benefit the project and the relevant initiatives on the long run First Path: Carbon Trade mechanisms 1. A desktop review was conducted about carbon trading in general revealing the history and the fact that the 2008 global crisis has caused a slowdown in industrial development, causing industrial nations to slow-down their economic activity, and the resulting carbon emissions, which reduced their need to buy carbon credits, and caused a considerable reduction in carbon unit prices. This reduction has been consistent until the present day. 2. A meeting with His Excellency Dr. Ibrahim Saif, former minister of Planning and International Cooperation, former minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, current CEO of the Jordan Strategy Forum. The meeting revolved around the history of carbon trading in Jordan, especially for the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), which reported to Dr. Saif when he was minister of Energy. The summary of the discussion is that NEPCO did sell its carbon credits attained from renewable energy projects (solar and wind) with acceptable revenues, but the current prices have become too low and NEPCO is considering alternative trading methods to try and maximize value. 3. A meeting was conducted with, Secretary General of the Ministry of Environment, to discuss potential alternative mechanisms for carbon trading. His Excellency was very supportive of the initiative and confirmed the Government intent to identify ways to maximize its potential revenues from carbon credits related to mitigation projects such as those in the renewable energy space. The meeting resulted in the setting-up of another meeting with Eng. Bilal Shaqareen, Director of the Climate Change Directorate at the Ministry of Environment. 4. A meeting with climate change department revealed that the Government has been researching potential trading mechanisms and has been in contact with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat to allow them to introduce such new measures. Mr. Shaqareen highlighted the pros and cons of such approach including a potential upside in revenue by trading special cards that would be charged with carbon credit over time and sold to the highest bidder, and cons including a possibility that such mechanism may not allow Jordan to get its due credits towards achieving its sustainable development targets. The full report will include a deep analysis of the possible approaches and will result in a recommendation based on these options. Eng. Shaqareen also indicated that any such platform has to get the approval of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) as the central authority regulating such transactions. 5. A meeting with the CBJ was conducted to discuss the Government’s appetite for using such unconventional mechanisms and the potential risk of missing out of credit allocation as per Mr. Shaqareen’s comments. 6. A meeting was conducted with the NEPCO leadership and carbon specialists, which concluded the required meetings and data gathering component of this engagement. 7. Based on the above meetings and gathered data a detailed report clarifying the positon of Jordan in regard to Carbon Trade and environmental foot prints at global and national level was prepared and presented to the decision makers mainly Ministry of Environment based on their request. Also, it presented the position of the carbon trade mechanisms and recommendations. 8. The detailed report main sections are: Paris agreement, Evaluation of Carbon Trade, Main schemes of Carbon Trade, Case of Jordan, Jordan’s foot prints, Jordan’s GHG Inventory, Energy Planning, Mitigation Scenarios, proposed new Carbon Trade Mechanisms and recommendations. The project is following currently with Ministry of Environment the actions that they are taking based on the delivered report. Second Path: Trust Fund for saved electricity bills and sold surplus 1. On the other hand, we have discussed with the Directorate of Administrative and Financial Affairs the possibility of establishing a fund to invest the electricity savings resulting from schools using solar energy, and the establishment of an independent fund specifically for this purpose requires a technical and legal study. These meetings have revealed that no trust fund shall be established except under a system issued by the Council of Ministers which requires the political will of the competent minister. 2. Meet with relevant parliamentary committees: (Education Committee, Rural and Badia Committee, Environment Committee, Energy Committee) to find a new mechanism in cooperation with the electricity companies, the Ministry of Education, the Authority for Energy and Minerals and the Renewable Energy Fund to benefit from the surplus to support schools in poor and marginalized areas. 3. Discuss the alternatives to the proposed fund: such as Fils Rural Fund: The possibility of calculating surplus amounts and the need to balance them as money for rural villas and then load the cost of energy bill for poor schools at the expense of rural villages. 4. Also. The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (JREEEF) is another option: To invest money in favor of the Fund so that it can continue to provide solar 5. The final results were as follow: - Ministry of Education has informed us that they have established recently a trust fund within the Ministry in order to deposit the saved electrify bills and use them to cover the maintenance activities for rural and remote schools. - In regard to the money resulted from selling the produced surplus energy, the est option was JREEEF as it is an existing fund and mechanism within the Ministry and there is no need to establish new scheme associated with needed laws and legislations. JREEEF is already supporting schools with RE/EE systems and the transferred money will be used to continue these efforts. Currently, there discussions between the project and JREEEF president to facilitate this solution. Third Path: Prime Ministry 1. HRH Princess Alia has met with the former Minister of Education who became now the Prime Minister in order to discuss the possibility of establishing a Trust fund for the saved electricity bills for schools and the sold surplus energy to be used to support the schools located in rural and remote areas. The minster at that time welcomed the idea, but her moved to his new position as Prime Minister shortly 2. So, PAF has sent an official letter to the Prime Minister emphasizing again the importance of the above previously discussed proposals.', 'Are the target group engaged in the implementation of the project? Yes, Intensively. Please elaborate: - The intensive awareness workshops for the local communities surrounding the schools had mobilized the community to be part of the project activities and they are actively inquiring on educational courses to get better understanding on available technology and means of energy savings. - Introduce the revolving fund model at CBO’s to ease the economic burden: participating associations engaged in managing fund creation and operation. Once active, community members are sensitized on process and began applying for interest-free loans to finance renewable energy technologies at homes, shops and farms with confidence in the investment made and revenue on the longer term. - Renewable energy showrooms are established and illustrate RE technologies: shops display renewable energy products that the community members can purchase through an interest-free payment system, they have started utilizing the educational material in the shops to learn more on RE and EE. - CBO energy audit teams: recruited focal points and volunteers trained and tasked with energy audits are actively promoting the audit exercise, sensitizing community and illustrating saved electricity bill amounts after installing RE technology. - Community members gain confidence in RE concept and accrued savings, community members approached CBO’s to request audits at their homes and businesses and started apply for revolving fund loans. - RE&EE education and certification: youth in communities enrol in training module at the local vocational training centres to qualify for future green jobs. Due to the introduction of practical and theoretical training some post-graduate students are also enrolled. - Eco-school programs: students and teachers are enthusiastically participating in responsible energy practices and are holding science fairs and organizing events to celebrate achievements. As a result, schools falling out of the targeted lists in communities are expressing interest in participating in similar activities. - Parents-teachers councils were created in targeted schools to organize additional awareness sessions in communities while environment clubs were created and became part of the school system. - The remedial classes for students who dropped-out of school and their support in enrolment after the three month period of classes have ended. - The close cooperation with relevant stakeholders such as the VTC’s, Parliament, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Environment.']",['The Princess Alia Foundation'],"['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'The Princess Alia Foundation', 'Future Pioneers fo Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development']",d06dd36821112777120bdc8d33f51789,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Jordan', 'Jordan Valley', 'Ramtha', 'Irbid', 'Mafraq', 'North Shouneh']",['development'],['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs'],"['The Princess Alia Foundation', 'Future Pioneers fo Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development']",2025-06-04T09:23:07.385507

Deliverables Description: 1.1 A clean source of energy is provided for the selected schools 1.1.1 The project agreement was officially signed on July 1st, 2017 and the planned preparations and activities began shortly thereafter. 1.1.2 A kick off meeting between the project partners has been conducted and a Project Management Unit (PMU) was created to meet on a regular basis. Additionally, a communications plan was prepared for the project to better organize the communication channels, including emails and meetings with relevant stakeholders and other entities and internal meetings within the project Consortium: Princess Alia Foundation, Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities’ Members (FPEC) and Horizons for Green Development. 1.1.3 A full day meeting was organized for senior team members from the Stabilization and Humanitarian Aid Directorate on August 21, 2017 at PAF premises as part of the Reception in the Region program. The discussion was found to be fruitful as several fundamental points were discussed and clarified during this meeting, including project implementation and reporting. 1.1.4 The logical framework and Theory of Change have been revised to reflect the actual start of the project and the modified indicators to better measure the project progress and achievements. 1.1.5 Several meetings with main stakeholders and partners including Ministry of Education and National Energy Research Centre (NERC) to select the 100 schools that comply with the predefined vulnerability criteria were held. The requested schools have been selected and the project team began its field work to investigate the situation of these schools and the availability of active CBOs within their surrounding communities. 1.1.6 The project contracted the National Energy Research Centre (NERC) in order to assess the current electricity consumption at the selected 100 schools and specify the needed PV systems, heating and cooling systems and lighting systems to reduce the electricity bills to almost zero and improve the learning environment at the same time. The (100) schools were selected at the northern governorates in cooperation with Ministry of Education based on certain selection criteria such as the value of electricity bills, overcrowdings, poverty, number of Syrian students, elementary schools and number of teaching shifts. 1.1.7 Accordingly, three tenders were released and evaluated through an evaluation committee that gathered NERC, Ministry of Education (MoE) and Ministry of Public works. The three tenders were awarded on May and July 2017 and the work is in progress for the 100 schools. Support rendered by the Ministry of Education to this particular project made it possible to pay an outstanding balance identified in a concluded electric survey (JOD 126,007.0) due to the Electric Company. While this amount could have severely influenced available budget, MoE support made it possible that suppliers proceeded with the schedule as initially planned. 1.1.8 Several lessons learned can be documented from this experience. An important one is the necessity of schools’ roofs inspection before moving ahead with installing the PV systems or even the selection of the school in the first place. An agreement was signed with The Royal Scientific Society (RSS)/Buildings department in order to supervise the inspection of the selected schools’ roofs. When the roofs were inspected through laboratory testing, it was found that some of the schools’ buildings’ were week and can’t handle the new PV systems especially if we added the wind force and other weather factors. Some of the schools are 70 years old. Therefore, PAF’s team in cooperation with RSS’s team and the Ministry of education has extensive site visits to the northern governorates to select 19 new schools that are less than 20 years old and have similar capacities to the replaced ones. These schools have to go through NERC’s assessment in order to specify the required heating/cooling systems and PV capacities. An amendment to NECR agreement was crucial in this case to ensure proper technical supervision. 1.1.9 Currently, the Ministry of Renewable Energy has included the roofs’ inspection as a requirement and perquisite for installing the PV systems to ensure the safety of students and sustainability of the installed systems. 1.1.10 The three contractors managed to complete the final (100) schools by the deadline and have been fully equipped with PV systems, heating/cooling systems, new energy efficient lighting systems and full maintenance especially of doors and windows to ensure efficiency of the installed systems. 1.1.11 The project activities have crossed with the activities of another project which is the National Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (NAJMAH). This project focuses on improving the living conditions of Syrians and Jordanians through employing them in the maintenance activities of schools. This has interfered with the maintenance activities of some of our schools. In order to maximize the benefit, the project decided to leave the schools maintenance of the selected schools for NJAMAH and utilize the saved money to benefit other schools. 1.1.12 The project have utilized the savings to equip ten additional schools that have PV Systems through one of PAF previous projects with heating/cooling systems especially the ones in Jordan Valley in order to improve the learning environment there. 1.1.13 The (110) schools have been completed and handed over by the deadline. This will directly benefit more than 56,205 Jordanian and Syrian students of which are 23,204 boys and 33,001 girls, 45,625 are Jordanian students while 10,580 are Syrians. 1.1.14 In order to celebrate this success, a public event took place in one of the completed schools in North Shouneh on April 29, 2019 under the patronage of HRH Princess Alia Al-Hussien and the Netherlands Embassy. The event gathered the community leaders, relevant stakeholders, local authorities, VTC trainees, teachers and students and local CBOs. The event included clarifying the project achievements and the graduation of the VTC trainees in Al-Mashareh Center. Moreover, there was announcements for the different activities completed in Shouneh Women CBO which is one of the CBOs supported by the project and marketing for their honey products. 1.2 Improve learning environment at the selected schools: 1.2.1 The 100 selected schools profited further through their inclusion in the Eco-Schools program; where an international certified body is teaching students how to be active in changing others actions by rationalizing energy use through following best practices. Focal points and teachers from each school were selected, with assistance from the Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS) through a signed MOU with them. Focal points and teachers will remain in constant communication with the project team and they have participated in a training to gain further knowledge on climate change, energy challenges in Jordan, best practices and tools for rationing energy use and reducing costs and CO2 emissions as well as how to organize and implement team building activities between students from different backgrounds to ensure social cohesion and interaction. 1.2.2 So far, JREDS managed to complete the following; - The international Eco-Schools program was introduced to 100 schools. - TOT for 200 teachers (125 females and 75 males). - (9) Focal points volunteers appointed to follow up on activities in all selected schools. - (3,127) students were educated through the Eco-schools program. - Ran capacity building programs for the hired staff regarding action plan development, eco-schools and Shamouseh. - Printed and distributed promotional stickers in the “Turn off and save” (Tafeha o benhawesh) energy saving program across targeted schools. - Awareness campaign was launched via media outlets; Facebook, the press, e-letters and interviews organized to promote effective energy practices. 1.2.3 The project has conducted the post survey for the schools to measure the progress and achievements and completed the final evaluation. (46) Schools out of (100) have won the international eco-schools certification and a celebration event to honor these schools has been conducted on April 17, 2019. 1.2.4 In so doing, three components were brought to life; Shammousa Manual, distributed to schools outlining all relevant information related to renewable energy and the environment, development and distribution of (10,000) copies of an interactive CD game to the 100 schools, and the Educational Toolkit which was developed for a Virtual Reality program. 1.2.5 The Virtual Reality educational screening was developed in parallel with the Eco-schools program to create a live experience for students about RE/EE and to teach them about the environment and energy in an engaging approach. These measures have fully engaged students and introduced them to best practices on energy saving and promoted green culture. Students participated in an interactive virtual reality video that takes viewers on a dream like journey through space to better understand the operation of PV systems demonstrating how energy is generated and saved. So far (3,127) students experienced the video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWPU3kjNCJc&feature=youtu.be 1.2.6 To further support the awareness among students that are younger in age, an interactive song has been developed to teach the children bets practices to save energy and have been broadcasted on famous children channels to reach out to the largest possible number of children. https://youtu.be/smLSVlQwEOk 1.2.7 A website was developed through a specialized media company in order to map out the location of schools that are currently receiving funds and/or assistance related to environment or renewable energy and by whom to ensure no overlapping of schools or donors prioritizing similar projects. The 110 selected schools have also been marked on Google Maps for future reference. The website is launched here. http://solarjordanschools.com/ 1.2.8 Remedial classes and drop out of schools The project in cooperation with the local CBO’s have organized Summer remedial classes supported in the northern governorates, targeting Jordanian and Syrian students. Arabic, English and math lessons targeted out of school children, enabling them to apply for placement tests. A further professional program was developed in cooperation with “Youth Without Borders” CBO who are very active in Ramtha and one of the project CBO’s. They have cooperated with the Ministry of Education to attract 150 students who left school; those 150 students will be able to attend remedial classes over a three month time period and will then be enrolled back in schools. So far, (97) of these students have retuned back to school. Additionally, 500 students have benefited from this program: 276 boys (96 Jordanians and 180 Syrians) and 224 girls (101 Jordanians and 123 Syrian). 1.3 Awareness Workshops In Communities: 1.3.1 Outside the school sphere, the project has completed a CBO mapping activity where (60) CBO’s were visited and assessed by our team. Almost (10-15) CBO’s were selected for the awareness activities while four CBO’s have been selected to further enhance the local green initiatives and employment. 1.3.2 The host communities are actively engaged in conducting awareness workshops in cooperation with the selected women CBO’s. The project managed to complete the (100) awareness workshops for the communities surrounding the selected schools. Thematic topics address social cohesion and best practices on renewable energy that target Syrian and Jordanian women who will in turn spread awareness to their respective communities. Evaluating the pre and post surveys demonstrated the knowledge gained and the new positive attitude of 3,974 people of which are: 3,182 women and 792 men (2,854 Jordanians and 1,120 Syrians). 1.4 The role of women-led CBO’s in empowering women, reducing poverty and promoting the green culture in the surrounding communities 1.4.1 Forged partnership with five women CBO’s were established; in Mafraq, Ramtha, Sareeh/Irbid and the Jordan Valley, to develop their organizational and service minded skills for their communities. Women and youth employment is embedded within the activities through small income generating projects and the introduction of RE&EE technologies in close partnership of the private sector. Moreover, these CBOs have been supported by grants of a value of JOD 10,000 – 15,000 each in order to distribute revolving funds to people based in specific announcement methodology and selection criteria. 1.4.2 Coordinated with JREEEF who partially support the installation of the PV systems and solar heaters so that the remaining value will be covered by the CBO’s through the revolving fund mechanism. Our plan is to collaborate and make the process clear and more transparent for local communities in the northern governorates therefore becoming a realistic option for them. 1.4.3 Youth trained on RE&EE and teams run energy audits in their communities, raising awareness and promoting the added value when adopting those technologies. The teams are working in different environments and can tailor required equipment for each setting. 1.4.4 The progress of the activities in these CBOs is going very well benefiting the local communities while employing more than (15) local youth. Awareness and audit activities have reached out to more than 1,500 citizens who encouraged the people to have revolving funds to purchase RE&EE systems for their houses in order to reduce their electricity bills and reduce CO2 emissions by mainly using PV systems and solar heaters. 1.4.5 Revolving funds have been provide by these CBOs to encourage people purchase RE/EE systems that reduced the energy bills by 30-70%. These systems are ACs that saves energy, Photo Voltaic systems, solar heaters and others. So far, almost 150 families have benefited of these revolving funds and benefited from the provided services such as solar heaters, PV systems, AC’s which have been reflected positively as they used the savings to improve the socio-economic conditions of their families. The revolving funds scheme could sustain up to 10 years after the project completion 1.4.6 Two energy shops were created and equipped to showcase renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. The showrooms are managed by women CBO’s and employ youth from the local community. The equipped two RE/EE exhibitions have proved a successful business model where the exhibitions will be able to sustain after the project completion. 1.4.7 Linkages between the CBO’s and the local authorities are formed for future cooperation and support. 1.4.8 The above small initiatives have proved their success and the positive impact in terms of youth capacity building, employment and long standing green business models. Thus, the project has decided to benefit an additional CBO in Mafraq (making it the fifth) in order to expand the benefits to additional communities. 1.4.9 Forged cooperation and support with other projects that are funded by the Dutch Ministry such as the hydroponic agriculture that is implemented by Eco-Consult Company. Our project has provided one of our CBO’s with off-grid PV system for the Hydroponic unit provided by Eco-Consult to reduce their energy bill by 100% from JOD 300.0 to Zero. 1.4.10 Another PV system was provided to Mafraq CBO that has a small plastic house that plant organic products. 1.4.11 The honey production project run by PV system is progressing very well, employing four women and producing 500-800 kg/year. The built showroom is used to market the products. 1.4.12 To ensure synergies in different programs, one CBO was supported with a solar pump in an existing water purification plant. The plant now runs a full eco-system. 1.4.13 Equipped training halls were and will be used for training and awareness for the local communities. These halls will act like a hub for the local community members, to announce the CBO’s available services under the project as well as be used for different renewable energy and energy efficiency awareness events. So far, four workshops were conducted which targeted 800 citizens (male and female). 1.4.14 The CBO’s premises are maintained and equipped with necessary furniture and equipment in order to improve services and to ensure consistent income generation by renting out the facilities. 1.5 Vocational Training Centers (VTC’s) 1.5.1 To sustain the green job’s creation efforts, and by following the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Princess Alia Foundation (PAF) and the VTC’s, the project has equipped three of the main vocational training centers with on-grid and off-grid educational PV systems. - A one-week ToT session was organized by the EU TA II program manager for 5 teachers. The ToT was crucial in order for the teachers to impart to youth how to install and maintain the RE & EE systems and expand the benefits for all communities. - Energy curriculum training material was developed (in cooperation with the EU) where 250 copies were printed and distributed to VTC’s. - Photo-voltaic education simulators (on/off grids) were installed in 3 VTC’s in the northern governorates; Irbid, Jordan Valley and Mafraq. - Educational tool kits were developed and will be distributed to graduates. - (103) students; 39 females and 64 males, enrolled in a 6 month RE&EE VTC training program. Graduates shall receive a ‘skilled’ level diploma. 1.5.2 The six months training course for the trainees was completed successfully and they have passed the needed certification exams and received a ‘skilled’ level diploma. An official graduation took place during a public event on April 29, 2019 under the patronage of HRH Princess Alia Al-Hussien. 1.5.3 The equipped VTCs should be able to sustain after the project completion as it is equipped with all needed PV systems, tools and training materials, and the new certified green job became well known in their area. So, after the project completion, this certification will be opened for the youth with certain fees like the other certifications in the VTC centers. 1.5.4 The Employment Application is completed and it was launched on Android and IPhone, but at later stage and as the same consortium is implementing another project in the area funded by the Canadians where there is more focus on clean technology, enhancing entrepreneurship among women and men, it was decided to postpone a bit little in order to build upon this Mobile App and make it more advanced and provide several options for the trained youth such as employment opportunities entrepreneurship, salesmen and women and brokers. The second project has built upon the results of our project and trained the trainees on sales and business skills to enable them open their own business. Moreover, the second project will conduct large awareness campaigns to teach trained youth how to use this platform. The other project will continue until Dec 2020 which will provide an opportunity for follow up and mentor the function of the App. 1.5.5 (10) Graduates of the VTC; males and females were employed by the contractors who installed the RE/EE systems for the 110 schools. 1.6 Lobbying and Advocacy 1.6.1 Signing partnership MOU’s with different parties; VTC’s, Mercy Corps, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Development to ensure their cooperation and support for the project. 1.6.2 PAF has managed to lobby for the inclusion of RE systems in building codes for future schools. Furthermore, it is in the process of changing the current school electricity tariffs to a lower rate as they are currently being charged with a commercial tariff (which is the highest). 1.6.3 The project has signed two contracts with two different experienced consultants. The first consultant will follow the establishment and set-up of a central/general fund, where every school can allocate their energy savings/earnings in one location. By equipping schools with RE&EE systems, they will be provided with free and clean energy for the next 25 years, allowing them to create a surplus of produced energy that can be sold to electricity companies and to transfer savings made to this trust fund. The second consultant has tackled the carbon trade mechanism in cooperation with the Ministry of environment as the installed systems will reduce CO2 emissions by almost 5,000 tons annually. Also, he has followed this matter with the Parliament. In order to further follow this assignment, three paths have been followed First Path: Carbon Trade mechanisms - A desktop review was conducted about carbon trading in general revealing the history and the fact that the 2008 global crisis has caused a slowdown in industrial development, causing industrial nations to slow-down their economic activity, and the resulting carbon emissions, which reduced their need to buy carbon credits, and caused a considerable reduction in carbon unit prices. This reduction has been consistent until the present day. - A meeting with His Excellency Dr. Ibrahim Saif, former minister of Planning and International Cooperation, former minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, current CEO of the Jordan Strategy Forum. The meeting revolved around the history of carbon trading in Jordan, especially for the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), which reported to Dr. Saif when he was minister of Energy. The summary of the discussion is that NEPCO did sell its carbon credits attained from renewable energy projects (solar and wind) with acceptable revenues, but the current prices have become too low and NEPCO is considering alternative trading methods to try and maximize value. - A meeting was conducted with, Secretary General of the Ministry of Environment, to discuss potential alternative mechanisms for carbon trading. His Excellency was very supportive of the initiative and confirmed the Government intent to identify ways to maximize its potential revenues from carbon credits related to mitigation projects such as those in the renewable energy space. The meeting resulted in the setting-up of another meeting with Eng. Bilal Shaqareen, Director of the Climate Change Directorate at the Ministry of Environment. - A meeting with climate change department revealed that the Government has been researching potential trading mechanisms and has been in contact with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat to allow them to introduce such new measures. Mr. Shaqareen highlighted the pros and cons of such approach including a potential upside in revenue by trading special cards that would be charged with carbon credit over time and sold to the highest bidder, and cons including a possibility that such mechanism may not allow Jordan to get its due credits towards achieving its sustainable development targets. The full report will include a deep analysis of the possible approaches and will result in a recommendation based on these options. Eng. Shaqareen also indicated that any such platform has to get the approval of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) as the central authority regulating such transactions. - A meeting with the CBJ was conducted to discuss the Government’s appetite for using such unconventional mechanisms and the potential risk of missing out of credit allocation as per Mr. Shaqareen’s comments. - A meeting was conducted with the NEPCO leadership and carbon specialists, which concluded the required meetings and data gathering component of this engagement. - Based on the above meetings and gathered data a detailed report clarifying the positon of Jordan in regard to Carbon Trade and environmental foot prints at global and national level was prepared and presented to the decision makers mainly Ministry of Environment based on their request. Also, it presented the position of the carbon trade mechanisms and recommendations. - The detailed report main sections are: Paris agreement, Evaluation of Carbon Trade, Main schemes of Carbon Trade, Case of Jordan, Jordan’s foot prints, Jordan’s GHG Inventory, Energy Planning, Mitigation Scenarios, proposed new Carbon Trade Mechanisms and recommendations. - Results: The project is following currently with Ministry of Environment the actions that they are taking based on the delivered report. H.E Secretary general took some solid and positive decisions to follow this approach. Second Path: Trust Fund for saved electricity bills and sold surplus - On the other hand, we have discussed with the Directorate of Administrative and Financial Affairs the possibility of establishing a fund to invest the electricity savings resulting from schools using solar energy, and the establishment of an independent fund specifically for this purpose requires a technical and legal study. These meetings have revealed that no trust fund shall be established except under a system issued by the Council of Ministers which requires the political well of the competent minister. - Meet with relevant parliamentary committees: (Education Committee, Rural and Badia Committee, Environment Committee, Energy Committee) to find a new mechanism in cooperation with the electricity companies, the Ministry of Education, the Authority for Energy and Minerals and the Renewable Energy Fund to benefit from the surplus to support schools in poor and marginalized areas. - Discuss the alternatives to the proposed fund: such as Fils Rural Fund: The possibility of calculating surplus amounts and the need to balance them as money for rural villas and then load the cost of energy bill for poor schools at the expense of rural villages. - Also. The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (JREEEF) is another option: To invest money in favor of the Fund so that it can continue to provide solar 1. The final results were as follow: - Ministry of Education has informed us that they have established recently a trust fund within the Ministry in order to deposit the saved electricity bills and use them to cover the maintenance activities for rural and remote schools. - In regard to the money resulted from selling the produced surplus energy, the best option was JREEEF as it is an existing fund and mechanism within the Ministry and there is no need to establish new scheme associated with needed laws and legislations. JREEEF is already supporting schools with RE/EE systems and the transferred money will be used to continue these efforts. JREEEF president has welcomed this decision and to facilitate this solution. Third Path: Prime Ministry 1. HRH Princess Alia has met with the former Minister of Education who became now the Prime Minister in order to discuss the possibility of establishing a Trust fund for the saved electricity bills for schools and the sold surplus energy to be used to support the schools located in rural and remote areas. The minster at that time welcomed the idea, but her moved to his new position as Prime Minister shortly 2. So, PAF has sent an official letter to the Prime Minister emphasizing again the importance of the above previously discussed proposals. 3. Result: the most preferred solution was to use an existing system mainly JREEEF trust fund instead of establishing a new one', 'Elaboration: All outputs have been completed without delays in agreement with the set timeline. The different activities linked and contributed to each other. To give an idea; At the local level youth are targeted through awareness sessions on renewable energy, energy efficiency and green jobs. In schools, the Eco-Program is introduced and teachers are trained on developing an environmental action plan. The program promotes green thinking and children are stimulated to design their own ideas. Complementary educational tools are developed to bring a comprehensive experience; VR, digital games and manual. Training manuals developed and accredited to be taught at local VTC centers. Courses offer theoretical and practical training with available on-off grid PV demonstrations. Graduates receive certified diplomas and are linked for job opportunities with the private sector; contracted suppliers. Furthermore, a mobile application is being developed in order to concretely link job seekers with potential employers. The application is free of charge and will be announced during training as soon as its operational. Simultaneously, targeted CBOs are supported to become green hubs to link all initiatives together those include; financial training, infra-structure support, income generation interventions, RE and EE revolving fund, job opportunities and continued awareness campaigns. Completed Outputs according to the logical framework are: • (110) schools selected in communities affected by the Syrian students to have improved learning environment through equipping them with renewable energy systems, energy efficiency lights, Heating /cooling systems, free electricity for operating the learning tools such as computers, internet and access to on-line curricula . This will directly benefit more than 56,205 Jordanian and Syrian students of which are 23,204 boys and 33,001 girls, 45,625 are Jordanian students while 10,580 are Syrians. • Targeted schools are sensitized on the Eco-Schools program introduced by an international certified entity to teach students how to be active in changing positive behaviors by rationing energy use and adopting best practices \uf0fc The international Eco-Schools program was introduced to 100 schools. \uf0fc TOT for 200 teachers (125 females and 75 males). \uf0fc (9) Focal points volunteers appointed to follow up on activities in all selected schools. \uf0fc (3,127) students were educated through the Eco-schools program • Students participated in an interactive virtual reality video that takes viewers on a dream like journey through space to better understand the operation of PV systems demonstrating how energy is generated and saved. So far (3,127) students experienced the video. • Additionally, 10,000 digital CDs, 10,000 educational Shamousa manuals support extracurricular activities in schools. • Evaluating the pre and post surveys of the awareness workshops conducted for the surrounding communities demonstrated the knowledge gained and the new positive attitude of 3,974 people of which are: 3,182 women and 792 men (2,854 Jordanians and 1,120 Syrians). • (15) Local youth have been trained and employed to spread awareness in the community and conduct energy audits at household level. So far, 1,500 citizens were targeted through workshops (male and female). • (5) Active CBOs were selected and equipped revolving funds and with proper training halls to become a hub for the local community and promote green culture. So far, more than 120 families have benefited from the provided services such as solar heaters, AC’s that save energy as well as other systems that have reduced their energy bills. • Training halls in CBOs used for extra learning spaces and remedial catch-up classes for drop-out children. Thus far, 600 students participated in this program: 276 boys (96 Jordanians and 180 Syrians) and 224 girls (101 Jordanians and 123 Syrians).

Qualitative indicators: - Introduced an innovative activity; virtual reality, to students in 5th and 6th grade proved to be significantly impressive for the learning experience. Particularly for RE&EE. The model could effectively provide an impactful experience to children in common settings where traditional means of education dominates the learning experience; (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jHP5YmgZXs) - Eco-Schools is the largest international school program promoting sustainability – the program starts in the classroom and expands to the community by engaging generations in action-based learning. Through this program, young people experience a sense of achievement at being able to have a say in the environmental management policies of their schools, ultimately steering them towards certification and the status associated with the Green Flag award. - Established environmental clubs and committees in schools (15 to 20 students aged 10-15) which support the creation of local change agents promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency practices. - Teachers are empowered to organize awareness sessions and diverse initiatives through a participatory approach with students and have created local councils. - Income generating projects supported employment in communities, provide skillsets to beneficiaries and work on improving standard of living for families. - Provided solar powered water purification systems and logistical equipment and allow local groups to benefit from these systems by reinvesting profits into their communities. - Empowered CBO’s to better serve communities and promote RE&EE technologies through different models; revolving fund, awareness sessions and energy audit exercises. - Connected CBO’s with local authorities to eliminate bureaucratic barriers and create partnerships. - Established energy shops that are managed and run by CBO’s. - Supplied targeted VTC’s with necessary manuals on RE&EE, these were used to train community members, men and women, Syrians and Jordanians, on installation and maintenance. - Established an energy audit team to provide audits for households, farms and local private companies. In the 5 CBO’s a total of 15 volunteers are involved. These energy audits help community members understand their energy spending habits and patterns to modify them in order to reduce energy bills and raise awareness. - Promoted RE&EE in a local youth conference; the Arab Noor Conference, on supporting local businesses and young entrepreneurs. - Activated new actions through Ministry of Environment for the Carbone Trade mechanisms - Facilitated adopting JREEEF as the trust fund for sold electricity by schools to be used to support other schools.

Once active, community members are sensitized on process and began applying for interest-free loans to finance renewable energy technologies at homes, shops and farms with confidence in the investment made and revenue on the longer term. - Renewable energy showrooms are established and illustrate RE technologies: shops display renewable energy products that the community members can purchase through an interest-free payment system, they have started utilizing the educational material in the shops to learn more on RE and EE. - CBO energy audit teams: recruited focal points and volunteers trained and tasked with energy audits are actively promoting the audit exercise, sensitizing community and illustrating saved electricity bill amounts after installing RE technology. - Community members gain confidence in RE concept and accrued savings, community members approached CBO’s to request audits at their homes and businesses and started apply for revolving fund loans. - RE&EE education and certification: youth in communities enrol in training module at the local vocational training centres to qualify for future green jobs. Due to the introduction of practical and theoretical training some post-graduate students are also enrolled. - Eco-school programs: students and teachers are enthusiastically participating in responsible energy practices and are holding science fairs and organizing events to celebrate achievements. As a result, schools falling out of the targeted lists in communities are expressing interest in participating in similar activities. - Parents-teachers councils were created in targeted schools to organize additional awareness sessions in communities while environment clubs were created and became part of the school system. - The remedial classes for students who dropped-out of school and their support in enrolment after the three month period of classes have ended. - The close cooperation with relevant stakeholders such as the VTC’s, Parliament, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Environment.', 'Sustainability Expected follow-up: describe the activities that will ensure continuation upon the completion of the project. - Ensure VTC’s continue to run training sessions on RE&EE in optimal standards; both at theoretical and practical levels. Trained youth are expected to be equally engaged in the labour market and in their communities to advocate for energy efficiency best practices. - Closely follow interventions launched by CBO’s and offer support where needed with regards to effective management and operation. - Running activities within the eco-schools program are intended to continue to enrich and sustain awareness amongst students, teachers, parents and community members in order to fully recognise their capacity and the importance of taking care of the environment so that they have the motivation to continue applying responsible energy practices when the project is complete. - Maintenance follow-up for the installed RE/EE systems at schools including PV’s, AC’s, and energy efficient light bulbs. This will be done through the contractors and trained youth in the different communities. Sustainability which will be ensured as follow: a. Financial sustainability: • All the purchased and installed solar systems shall have a high return on investment; the systems are paid for only once, and will eventually cover their cost in (3-5) years. These systems will operate and generate electricity for at least 25 years. So, the savings for Ministry of Education will be on average JOD500/Month/school which equal to annual savings for the 100 schools equal to almost JOD 600,000 and almost 15.0 million over the 25 years. There will be a documented study produced by NERC once all the systems are installed and operated. • The improved learning environment for the upcoming 25 years will contribute to improve the educational achievements and retention in these schools. • The equipped VTCs to be certified training centers to train people on installing and maintaining PV systems will continue to run training sessions on RE&EE in optimal standards; both at theoretical and practical levels. Trained youth are expected to be equally engaged in the labour market and in their communities to advocate for energy efficiency best practices. • The trained youth through the VTCs shall have better chances to get jobs and therefore to support their families which in consequent shall raise livelihood status of the community. a percentage of these youth will be employed by the three contractors in this project to cover the maintenance of installed systems for the upcoming three years • The supported CBOs that are equipped with trained youth, revolving funds, training halls, productive initiatives, and RE/EE systems will continue their business and activities and continue to be the gathering hub for their communities and continue serving them utilizing the provided tools and equipment. • The implemented eco-schools program have a direct impact on the students in terms of raising their awareness about protecting the environment, changing their behavior and ensure their commitment to improve their environment through adopting the best practices on the long term. the provided educational games on DVDs and educational manuals will ensure mire sustainability. b. Policy level sustainability: • The project is contributing to the government efforts and policies to mitigate the impact of the Syrian crisis. • The project is involving the relevant authorities, electricity company , parliament and other relevant stakeholders in order to establish a trust fund for the schools to benefit of the sold surplus of produced electricity through the installed RE/EE systems to benefit the rural schools or to pay the electricity bills for the schools that are not supported by RE/EE systems. • Another consultant have been recruited by the project to follow with Ministry of environment, Ministry of Energy and electricity company a new mechanism to benefit from the reduced CO2 emissions especially that the existing mechanism have proved to be not beneficial after a while. There are some plans to establish a trading platform to open the door for the investors and other projects to benefit from the new planned mechanisms. c. Environmental sustainability: • The project has contributed to the initiatives established on the local, national and international levels in combating climate change effects and acted as a useful mitigation measure especially on reducing the emissions of Green House Gases • Additionally, the capacity building of local youth, students and the awareness workshops for the community members on renewable energy importance and need has supported the environmental adoption of best practices . d. Social sustainability: • This project has worked on promoting the social cohesion between the Syrian refugees and hosting communities through conducting more than 50 workshops that gathered more than 2,000 people of both nationalities and improved their knowledge about the importance of social cohesion and community solidarity. • Moreover, the project has built the capacity of five of the most active CBOs with infra-structure, training and job creation. Those activities are a concrete component that can serve communities even after the project completion.']",['The Princess Alia Foundation'],"['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'The Princess Alia Foundation', 'Horizons for Green Development', 'Future Pioneers fo Empowering Communities']",9cf0af0d1c293d205217ee2d55bff2a5,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['northern governorates', 'Jordan Valley']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs'],"['The Princess Alia Foundation', 'Horizons for Green Development', 'Future Pioneers fo Empowering Communities', 'National Energy Research Centre (NERC)', 'The Royal Scientific Society (RSS)', 'Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS)', 'Youth Without Borders']",2025-06-04T09:23:07.548688

The two components are mutually reinforcing. The work on apprenticeship will contribute to the component of the NES related to skills-. The project will prioritize areas of high refugee population, and direct services will target young Syrian refugees. The project will have two levels of inter-related outcomes: 1. Capacity for a coordinated NES implementation strengthened The NES implementation has so far suffered from a lack of consultation with social partners and line ministries. Its relevance has also been questioned because of the changing economic and political situation. Moreover, its impact has not been visible yet due to the management structure which is outside the purview of the Ministry of Labour and social partners, and due to the absence of a transparent monitoring and evaluation framework. The Government is currently keen to address the labour market challenges which have been exacerbated by the Syrian Refugee crisis and one way to do so is through expediting the NES implementation. Consequently, this project will implement two interrelated levels of interventions: expanding impact and strengthening policy coordination. 2. A National Apprenticeship System established- with upgraded informal apprenticeship practices for young Syrians There is a strong link between this proposal and the first phase of the SIDA funded project on youth employment: in the first phase, a successful pilot was undertaken to upgrade informal apprenticeships. It generated great interest from national stakeholders, who expressed commitment to partner with ILO for the improvement of their workplace based training programmes. In parallel, the design of an apprenticeship “tool kit” is well under way based on a review of international good practices. It includes detailed guidance on (a) possible legal and policy framework for an apprenticeship system, (b) a contract template based on ILS – being validated by NORMES, (c) social dialogue guidance for designing and managing apprenticeship systems, (d) one week modular course on pedagogical skills for master craft-persons – among other components.']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],0bc1a305372e4584c36c866bfff4a02e,['Syria'],['refugees'],"['urban', 'rural']",['Jordan'],"['humanitarian', 'development']","['Sweden', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],2025-06-04T09:23:12.310135

The resulting impoverished circumstances of many Syrian refugees are leading them to seek any form of income to provide for their families, which is further exacerbating tensions between host and migrant labour communities. Due to the lack of access to allowed formal jobs for parents and lack of vocational opportunities for Syrian adolescents, many households resort to child labour. Through this project funded by DANIDA, the ILO will contribute to the elimination of child labour, especially its worst forms, among Syrian refugees and host communities in Jordan and Lebanon. In order to achieve this objective, this eighteen-month project will focus on capacity-building and policy dialogue with Government ministries and departments, in line with ILO's past and on-going interventions on child labour in the two countries""]",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],98fd18110f32e67820c79762be49af19,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",[],"['Jordan', 'Lebanon']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['Denmark, Danish International Development Agency', 'DANIDA']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],2025-06-04T09:23:09.954887

Hankkeen perustelut: \nKaupungistuminen, keskiluokan kasvu ja pakolaiskriisi ovat tekijöitä, jotka lisäävät jätteen määrää Jordaniassa.

Hanke perustuu oletukselle, että jos nuoret Jordaniassa, mukaan lukien pakolaiset, ovat tietoisia kiertotalouden mahdollisuuksista ja heillä on alkupääomaa pienimuotoisiin Zero Waste -projekteihin, luodaan työllisyyttä ja uusia tapoja vastuulliseen jätehuoltoon, joita voidaan myös kasvattaa suuremmiksi.

The majority of them are above the minimum age for employment, indicating that the main problem lies in the conditions of work and other worst forms that child labourers in the 16 to 18 age group suffer from. Given the low and perhaps manageable number of child labourers, Jordan could be one of the first countries to become child labour free if concerted efforts are made to reach even the hard-to-reach, ensure occupational safety for the above 16s and link the families of child labourers with social protection schemes of the State. This four-year project (2010 – 2014) will prepare the ground for the country to move towards this. It builds on the previous IPEC Action Programme and Country Programme (2002 – 2007) also supported by the US Department of Labor (USDOL) and complements other initiatives of the Government of Jordan and civil society aimed at reducing drop-out from basic education, improving working conditions for youth and eliminating child labour. In particular, it will build the capacity of the Child Labour Unit (CLU) of the Ministry of Labour (MoL) to coordinate the implementation of the National Framework on Child Labour (NFCL) being developed under the “Combating Exploitative Child Labor through Education” (CECLE) project. Since the NFCL is not yet available, this project document will be finalised after a meeting in March 2011 to be organized by USDOL that will bring together USDOL, USDOL’s various Jordan grantees (ILO, CECLE and the FY2010 Child Labour Elimination project grantee) and perhaps other relevant stakeholders to discuss the role of each entity in implementing the NFCL. Child Labour Situation Child labour in Jordan is mainly concentrated in the governorates of Amman, Zarka, Balqa and Irbid. Participants at the stakeholder workshop conducted on October 7, 2010 as a preparation for this proposal were also concerned about the increase in child labour linked to tourism in the region of Petra and among children living in certain refugee camps in the outskirts of Amman. All the surveys confirm that large family size, low levels of education of parents, and intergenerational poverty are the main causes of child labour. This is compounded by the difficulty that families of child labourers experience in accessing social support from the State. A paradox that is found in many countries is that child labour persists in the context of high rates of youth unemployment. In 2008, the unemployment rate in the 16 to 19 age group was as high as 32.8% against a general unemployment rate of 12.7% in that year. There is clearly a need to, on the one hand, reorient demand away from child labour towards youth and, on the other, to reduce the occupational risks that the 16 -18 age group faces by enforcing occupational safety and health (OSH) standards present in Jordanian labour law. No studies have been done so far on the worst forms of child labour (WFCL) other than hazardous work. The Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) on hazardous work indicated that 13% of working children are working against their will and recommended that priority be given to withdrawing them. The US Trafficking in Persons Report 2009 also refers to forced child labour stating that “Some Jordanian children employed within the country as street vendors, carpenters, painters, mechanics, domestics, restaurant staff, or agricultural labourers may be exploited in situations of forced labour.” Forced child labour is another area requiring further investigation and action. Legal and policy framework Jordan has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and ILO Convention No.s 138 (C138) and 182 (C182).

As a country with few natural resources, Jordan looks to its human resources as the key element for its success and the prosperity, health, and security of its people. Despite the very high enrolment rates and the availability of access to schools across the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. The average achievement in urban areas is higher than that in the rural and more remote areas. One of the major challenges of the Ministry of Education is to provide the schools with the required budget to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum learning. The schools in remote areas lack sufficient financial resources to improve the schools’ environment. With limited access to adequate electricity to operate daily services such as the use of efficient heating and cooling systems within the classrooms during extreme temperatures, lighting, connecting computers and the use of online learning, sustainable and beneficial learning environments are implausible. The large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan since 2011 has increased the load on the Kingdom’s already limited resources. Key drivers of tension between the host community and the refugees at the micro-level are safeguarding livelihoods and competition for income-generating opportunities; the struggle to find adequate, affordable housing; and challenges in the education sector such as difficulty in accessing adequate education as well as a deteriorating learning environment. The Syrian crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than ever. As per the latest statistics, electricity consumption in the northern governorates (those mostly affected by the Syrian crisis) showed an additional increase of 2.3 per cent compared to other governorates in Jordan. This project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa’a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time. Providing the schools with innovative techniques to reduce expenditure in energy bills and generate income will greatly relieve the ministry of the financial burden as well as allowing students, regardless of geographic location and nationality access to a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum academic achievement.']",['Horizons for Green Development'],"['Princess Alia Foundation', 'Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development', 'Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs']",849e54bda7e190387dfa88dedf1a55a7,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['rural', 'urban']","['Jordan', 'Mafraq', 'Ramtha', 'Irbid', 'North of Balqa’a Governorates', 'northern Jordan']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands']","['Princess Alia Foundation', 'Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities', 'Horizons for Green Development']",2025-06-04T09:24:32.001728

It has affected particularly the neighboring states. For example Jordan currently hosts 671.000 Syrian refugees.In 2019 Brussels conference the internatio\nnal community promised to keep supporting Syrian neighbouring countries. Finland pledged to support the crisis response for 25 million euros in 2019. In particular Finland promised to keep supporting the livelihood and education opportunities for women and\n children affected by the crisis. Women are often among the vulnerable groups particularly affected by the Syrian crisis. According to a vulnerability mapping conducted by UN Women for the Syrian refugee women it is particularly difficult to find employmen\nt. Some of the contributing factors include the current legislation and the low number of work permits for refugee women the cultural norms as well as lack of education possibilities for women. Women are also often more affected by gender-based violence. T\nhese same factors also affect the most vulnerable Jordanian women.The third phase of the UN Women?s project Eid-bi-Eid (Hand in Hand) supports the econominc empowerment of the most vulnerable women. Beneficiaries include particularly the Syrian refugee wom\nen and the most vulnerable Jordanian women. The objective of the project is improve women?s employment through: 1) influencing the Jordanian national legislation and policies 2) offering cash-for-work employment opportunities for women in refugee camps 3) \nexpanding cash-for-work support to vulnerable women outside camps 4) offering support to victims of gender-based violence and by implementing activities to prevent violence and5) promoting dialogue and civil society participation in women?s empowerment inc\nluding by influencing on men?s attitudes.

Suomi lupasi jatkaa etenkin naisten ja lasten elinkeinojen ja koulutuksen tukemista.Syyrian kriisissä etenkin naiset ovat usein haavoittuvassa asemassa. UN Womenin tekemän haavoittuvuusanalyysin mukaan Jordaniassa olevie\nn pakolaisnaisten työllistyminen on erityisen vaikeaa. Tähän vaikuttavat esimerkiksi lainsäädäntö ja työlupien vähäinen määrä kulttuuriset normit ja naisten heikot kouluttautumismahdollisuudet. Naiset ovat myös useammin seksuaalisen väkivall\nan uhreja. Samat tekijät vaikuttavat myös heikoimmassa asemassa olevien jordanialaisnaisten asemaan.UN Womenin Eid-bi-Eid (Käsi kädessä) ?hankkeen 3. vaihe tukee  haavoittuvassa asemassa olevien naisten voimaantumista.

Hanke on edistänyt Jordanian kansallisten suunnitelmien kehittämistä tasa-arvokysymykset paremmin huomioiviksi. Etenkin hankkeen toteuttamaa Oasis-mallia pidetään onnistuneena naisten aseman edist\nämisessä kokonaisvaltaisesti.

The country hosts nearly 700 000 registered Syrian refugees, while its own economy has been in decline for years and the unemployment rates especially among the youth are high.

Duty-bearers ignore their SRH-R, healthcare workers mistreat them, and adult family members decide about their sexuality and access to SRH-R information and services. They belong to the ones most left behind and hardest to reach: young women and adolescent girls (15-30 years) who self-identify as lesbian, bisexual, trans or intersex (LBTI), live with HIV or disabilities, or are affected by displacement. We call these women rightsholders, because that is what they are: holders of rights. We will pay special attention to young women at the intersection of multiple stigmatised identities, drawing among others on the learnings of inspiring programmes such as Voice and Right Here Right Now.\xa0We Lead believes in the right of every individual to decide about her, his or their own body and sexual and reproductive life. We are convinced that having this decision-making power is crucial for a person’s wellbeing, and a basic condition to thrive and find fulfilment in all other areas of life.', ""1.\xa0In June 2023, six Jordanian civil society organisations members of the We Lead Community of Action made a significant impact with its Universal Periodic Review (UPR) submission to the United Nations Human Rights Council Review of Jordan (Fourth Cycle Jan. – Feb. 2024) – 45th Session. The submission focused on promoting women's Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) and empowering young women as rights holders and advocates for SRHR.\xa0The review highlighted disparities in contraceptive use and the lack of age-appropriate SRHR education in schools. Access to services in rural areas and for individuals with disabilities was also limite.\xa0The UPR submission emphasized the need for effective legislation and mechanisms to ensure rights-based sexual and reproductive service delivery. The coalition passionately advocated for ending the practice of sterilizing women and girls with disabilities without informed consent, promoting inclusivity and equal access to quality care.\xa02.\xa0On June 26th, 2023, six community journalists in Nairobi, from Ruben Fm, Pamoja Fm, The Voice of Kenya, and Mtaani Radio, collaborated with AFOSI to implement the We Lead program following a capacity-building training aiming to create awareness on matters Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRH-R) which resulted to Voice of Kenya publishing a video of a Right Holder being interviewed about Sexual & Reproductive Health.\xa0By leveraging the reach and influence of These radio stations, the program has the potential to disseminate critical SRH-R information to a wide audience, thereby promoting informed decision-making and healthier behaviors within the community. The publication of a video interview by The Voice of Kenya demonstrates the programs ability to engage with local media outlets, facilitating network and coalition building That can strengthen the programs impact and reach even more individuals.3.\xa0On August 28, 2023, the Ministry of Health in the Alta Verapaz region signed a commitment agreement with the organization OTRANS-RN. The commitment involves providing quality and warm services in various health care aspects, respecting the identity of Trans individuals and ensuring compliance with the care strategy.\xa0\xa0It is crucial to raise awareness about the health strategy to ensure that the services provided are of high quality, warmth, and gender-inclusive.\xa0The organization OTRANS-RN, through previous monitoring using its own tools, collected information and prioritized the Alta Verapaz department to continue enhancing the institutional capacities of health centers."", 'The program puts young women rightsholders in the driver’s seat, connecting them with each other in Communities of Action. In these spaces they share knowledge, experiences and ideas, and learn from one another, while they also develop joint strategies to improve their SRH-R. We accompany and coach them as they work towards achieving the legal and policy changes they have targeted. The program also empowers these young women to participate in movements and develop and lead campaigns to change the perceptions of policy makers and the public on rightsholders’ SRH-R. An innovative participatory grant-making mechanism provides financial support for them to realize their plans and build and strengthen their organizations. Throughout the program there is continuous attention for rightsholders’ safety and security, and for their psychosocial wellbeing.']",['Hivos'],['Hivos Foundation'],3c9cb3f7432191faa7b0a6685c85bd67,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],['general_population'],[],"['Jordan', 'Gaza', 'New York', 'Thailand', 'Montreal', 'Kigali', 'Lebanon', 'Palestine']",['development'],['Hivos Foundation'],['Hivos'],2025-06-04T09:26:53.152889

The initiative is central to the broader UNICEF initiative ""No Lost Generation"", which commenced in 2013 to ensure quality education and children\'s right to security and protection as part of the Syria response in both Syria and in neighboring countries.\n\nChildren who complete the Catch-up programme have the opportunity to resume their formal schooling, which is the ultimate programme objective. The programme aims to provide an opportunity for 25,000 children to study in the ""Catch-up classes"" annually, to enable their entry or re-entry to formal schooling.\n\nThe programme supports the implementation of Sweden\'s Regional Strategy for the Syria Crisis 2016-2020 and specifically the Result Area 1: ""Strengthened resilience in Syria and neighboring countries with a focus on improved livelihoods, increased access to public services and reduced gender-based violence"".\n\nThe total budget from all donors is $50 Million USD over two years while Sida\'s support is 30 MSEK over two years, of which 20 MSEK is planned for 2016 whereas the remaining 10 MSEK for 2017.', 'Out-of-school\xa0boys and girls who are ineligible for formal schooling\xa0have access to the Catch-Up\xa0programme and the\xa0Drop-Out programme.

There is an urgent need to strengthen GAM\'s resilience  as well as to optimise its financing, and Tranche I will allow GAM to liberate  urgently needed funds to enable it to deal with the on-going challenges.  Tranche II of the investment package is targeted towards financing specific  investments in the solid waste sector to mitigate the effects of the refugee  influx and provide more sustainable and long-term solutions. These investments  will be assessed on a project-by-project basis and are expected to be  co-financed by investment grants made available by other partners, including,  but not limited to, the European Union.']",['European Bank for Reconstruction and Development'],"['European Bank for Reconstruction and Development', 'MUNICIPALITY OF GREATER AMMAN']",c1a380fa3c8b6bc68eba6180c649b81e,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",['urban'],"['AMMAN', 'Jordan']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['European Union', 'European Bank for Reconstruction and Development']","['European Bank for Reconstruction and Development', 'MUNICIPALITY OF GREATER AMMAN']",2025-06-04T09:33:25.628861

The loan will be co-financed by a  capex grant of up to EUR 8.0 million from the Community Resilience (""CR"") Sub  Account of the EBRD\'s SSF.  The city of Amman with a population of approx. 4.5 million, would like to  improve standards of the urban transport system, namely by expanding its bus  fleet through the purchase of up to 151 new buses with related bus depot  facilities. The proposed new bus fleet will involve 136 diesel Euro V buses (to  be financed under the Municipal Refugee Reslience Response (""MR3"") framework)  and 15 electric buses (to be financed under the Green Cities Framework  (""GrCF"")). The Project will serve new routes under the bus network plan  developed by GAM and will include a ticketing system and real-time information  systems compatible with their existing systems. The tender for the Project will  be launched in December 2020.   It is intended that the bus fleet will be purchased by GAM and leased to a  private sector operator which will be responsible for the depot facilities and  warranty and maintenance obligations for the fleet and be paid through a public  service contract (""PSC"") with Amman Vision for Transport (the municipal company  responsible for transport operations) under a gross-cost arrangement.

We analyse uptake and challenges of these technologies in four countries: Greece, Jordan, Lebanon and the UK. We include these countries because each has innovated solutions to refugee governance and integration, but in different ways with different outcomes. Our project includes surveys of organisations working in this field and in-depth case studies with humanitarian and refugee-led initiatives. Working across four countries, we are uniquely able to identify both local and global trends in techno-humanitarianism. Working with refugee-led organisations, the project will generate alternative models of financial inclusion and digital connectivity and work with   international stakeholders to overcome exclusion.\nAs the first transnational study of connectivity and debit cards for refugees, this research produces a timely and rigorous intervention in the context of refugee governance, where enduring refugees' forced displacement and destitution are matched by rapidly changing and often experimental governmental approaches using digital technologies. Our study of connectivity and debit cards for refugees maps their operation, effects, and long-term impact. Our study improves the understanding of these digital solutions offered to refugees beyond the promotional or anecdotal slogans that reduce complex processes to either 'innovations' that speed and individualize aid, or 'traps' that disguise surveillance under service provision"", 'Research and development activity contributing to the UK’s strategy to address key development challenges.']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL']",64decc6b76f218d234fe7fb3ebca873e,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],['refugees'],"['urban', 'rural']","['Greece', 'Jordan', 'Lebanon', 'UK']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL']",2025-06-04T09:33:56.769123

Annual Progress : \r\nIn May 2020, a contract was signed between the embassy of the kingdom of the Netherlands in Jordan and Penal Reform International to implement a project titled “Enhancing law enforcement response to COVID-19 in Jordan"".\r\nThe project worked during its six months period on promoting safe access to justice during the pandemic, including individuals who come in contact with the law enforcement and police officers, inmates, juveniles, children accompanying their mothers in jails. The project has succeeded in protecting the rights of individuals who come in contact with the law, either because they committed a crime or because they want to report a crime, or had the need to visit police stations, or courts or other judicial institutions for any reason. \r\nThe project targeted all the police stations, including the pre-trail hosting cells, as those cells are small, don’t have proper ventilation, and in most cases are overcrowded, and lack hygiene, in addition to the 13 Juvenile police stations.\r\nPolice officers who interact daily with the individuals who come in contact with the law were targeted to reduce the risk of being infected, and transferring the infection to their families. The same apply to the community police who was in need to interact with the community, responding to the Jordanian community needs during the lock down. \r\nPenal Reform International during the project has adopted a customized strategy to respond to the special needs of each category within the security system including the psychological, and physical needs, especially the most vulnerable segment of women, children accompanying their moms in prisons, juveniles. The project was able to provide a better health and justice solutions throughout the community. All which has resulted in a better functioning of the rule of the law system, and enhance the trust of individuals, and citizens in the police measures of maintaining health and safety.\r\nThe project direct beneficiaries are: The Public Security Directorate officers, including Juvenile police department, community police, individuals who comes in contact with the law and visit police stations, juveniles and children who comes with contact with the law and visit Juvenile police stations, male and female prisoners and children accompanying their mothers. \r\nCovid-19 pandemic has globally affected all countries and sectors since November 2019, Jordan and the security sector is part of this global pandemic, all the population which is in a direct interaction with the system-(The Public Security Directorate officers, including Juvenile police department, community police, individuals who come in contact with the law and visit the police stations, in addition to juveniles and children who visit Juvenile police stations, and  male and female  prisoners and children accompanying their mothers, were  at risk of being infected by the virus.\r\nIn Jordan there are 111 police station scattered across over the kingdom with an average of 84,000 visitors per month, also 17 prison institutions, with a total capacity of 13,352, and hold around 18,000 prisoners up till 20th of March 2020. The prisons were overcrowded, and the project activities came to support the national efforts, including supporting the initiative of the Judicial Council to take a decision of reducing overcrowding in prisons as an urgent response to reduce the rate of incarcerated personnel per prison to reduce the rate of spread of infections among inmates, and prison staff., the project also supported the prison department initiative to protect inmates and build an independence vis a vis the response to the pandemic , and create a production chain of safety gates.  On 24th of March 2020 the Judicial Council took a decision of an immediate release for all prisoners with a judgment less than 2 years and replacing the imprisonment with a ban on travel, including drug offenders. In addition to decision of not detaining any financial related crimes that amounts to less than (140,000 USD), replacing that with a ban on travel, and released all prisoners that fall under the same category of crime from prisons with a ban on travel. \r\n\r\nAs a result, for these measures around 6000 prisoners were released from prisons to reduce the prison population from 18,000 to 12,642 prisoners according to official statistics of Correctional and Rehabilitation Centers (CRCs) on the 6th of April 2020. Additionally, CRCs took a set of preventive measures inside the prisons that included allocating one prison only for new prisoners who will be detained all over Jordan (Al-Balqa prison). In an attempt to reduce the risk of infection spread which might be coming with new prisoners coming from outside the prisons. So, no new prisoners will be entering any of the prisons facilities that already had prisoners before, until they are quarantined for some time in Al-Balqa prison first. This will enable the CRCs to reduce the risk of infection spread that might come from outside the prisons, and maintain the health of inmates, prison staff, and their families at homes.', 'The project was implemented within the planned timeline, based on MoU’s and field inspection and follow up. \r\nPRI provided a rapid support for the Public Security Directorate and the Correctional and Rehabilitation Centers including Women Correctional and Rehabilitation Centers, along with the Juvenile police department to response to COVID -19 pandemic. The project was able to achieve the following outcomes and outputs as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutcome No. 1:\r\nNew behavioral and attitudinal practices adopted within the security system (represented mainly within the CRC and PSD, juvenile’s department boundaries) for responding to the COVID-19.\r\nPRI has developed a guideline which was adopted by the PSD, and the CRCs, including preventive measures in line with the WHO standards, to ensure safety of the police staff, individuals who come in contact with the law and the community in general. The PSD took new measures to respond to COVID-19 that were discussed in different meetings with PRI which included:\r\n•\tFamily visits suspended  in order to reduce the dangers of the contact with the contaminated outside world. \r\n•\tVirtual courts, which allowed an online adjudication of cases.\r\n•\tImmediate release of inmates with cases adjudicated up to two years, replacing it with a ban on travel, as an effort to end overcrowding.\r\n•\tAppointing Al-Balqa prison to be the only prison for admitting new prisoners, keeping them for a minimum of two weeks, to ensure  that they  are negative COVID-19 cases prior transferring them into other  prisons across the kingdom.\r\n\r\nOutcome No. 2: \r\nSelf-sufficiency approach through positively involving the prisoners adopted within the security system for securing the logistical and supply needs in emerging crisis. \r\nThe following outcome was achieved through utilizing the principle of give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime’, involving the prisoners in manufacturing sanitization gates at Al-Swaqa prison, then distributing them at all main entrances of  police stations, juveniles police departments and CRCs reaching  94.3% of self-sufficiency of those gates for the security sector as a whole.  The experience of involving the inmates in the production process of the sanitation gates has raised their confidence level, as they contributed in the national efforts towards combating the pandemic.\r\nAs the total number of police stations (111), juvenile police centers (13), and prisons (17) all across Jordan equaling  141., Producing 133 sanitation entrance gates, contributed to 94% of the total PSD needs. \r\nOutcome No. 3:\r\nTrust is enhanced, and made stronger due to the measures taken by the PSD to sustain access to safe justice and protect right to health and reach out to the community through community policing with positive messages, raising awareness of the public, and defending the public  right to health. \r\nThe Trust between the Jordanian society and the PSD has been enhanced, as a result of a set of activities delivered by PRI jointly with PSD which was promoted through national TV and social media platforms, radio broadcasting  .The trust gained by the Jordanian citizens can be demonstrated in two main proxy indicators:\r\n-The number of people that accessed the police stations has increased, or was not affected by the pandemic, in comparison with the same period of the previous year, which shows that the Jordanian community has the trust to go to the police stations when they need to get a service or have to report for a crime to those centres. \r\nIn the first three months of the lockdown and the domestic abuse crime rate increased by 33%, compared to the same time the year before. The stress level increased with a 1685 new domestic abuse cases made in the first three months of the lockdown including physical, sexual, and physiological abuses which caused the reported cases to increase at the police stations. .The citizens felt safe reporting their complains to the nearest police station to their homes, as they trust  the justice system, and   the PSD in protecting  their right. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the evaluation done with the direct beneficiaries from the One-Body initiative, shows the enhancement of the trust as the following statistics prove:\r\n\r\nAccording to a survey done with the direct beneficiaries of the 141 food parcels, 130 (92%) went to the police station to collect the parcels. Nine (6%) had the parcel delivered to their houses. 2% did not respond to the question. Of the 130 that went to the police station, seven had already been to the station before. 123 (95%) had never been to the police station before (36 or 29% Jordanians; 87 or 71% Syrians). One respondent specifically mentioned that due to living with physical handicap they were not able to go to the police station to collect the parcel, and therefore had it delivered.\r\n\r\nAlmost all (97%) of the respondents reported feeling ""completely safe"" when receiving the food parcel.  93% were ""completely satisfied"" with the distribution process. The 6% who were not satisfied did not provide a reason, although there were some remarks regarding the lack of shade at the distribution site or disorganised  distributions at first stages.  \r\nWhen asked ""Has your perception of the police been impacted?"" 94% reported it had for the better, 6% reported no change and 1% for the worse.\r\n\r\nOutputs:\r\nOutput 1.1: \r\nPRI managed to develop an educational campaign through creating awareness posters which promotes in easy language with photos the protective and preventive measures that should be taken and followed by the staff and the individuals who visited the police stations . 2000 posters were designed, printed out and distributed among all police stations including the Juvenile departments across the Kingdom. \r\n1400 posters were created targeting adults, and 600 child friendly poster taking into consideration a gender sensitive language in the design of the poster’s instructions and precautions measures \r\n(See Annex. No. 1 & 2) \r\n\r\nOutput 1.2: \r\nPRI in cooperation with the public security directorate developed a practical guideline on the response to COVID-19 at the police station’s level, based on the International Standards for Human Rights, WHO, OHCHR health instructions, and Child Rights Committee (CRC) and in line with the Jordanian laws and regulations. .. This guideline serves as a directive tool for the daily procedures that should be undertaken by the police station officers, including topics related to how to  mitigate the potential risks  resulting from COVID-19 to staff and individuals who come in contact with the law, in addition to preventative measures when dealing with COVID-19, starting at the external gates of the institutions. (See Annex No. 3)\r\n\r\nOutput 2.1: \r\nDuring the project lifetime PRI supported the PSD in creating a vocational training production line to produce the sanitation gates inside AL-Swaqa prison. PRI coordinated with PSD the production of the sanitation gates inside the prison involving  the inmates as part of supporting their rehabilitation, part of the national  efforts taken by the government to fight COVID-19.  \r\n\r\nA capacity building workshop on the vocational programme for the benefit of 45 prisoners was organised at the beginning of the project aiming at teaching the prisoners how to produce the gates. \r\n133 sanitation entrance gates produced  and  used at the entrance  of 111  police  station, 13 juvenile police stations, and prisons in Jordan including the female prisons. \r\nTo make sure that the workshop is sanitized properly and there is no risk for COVID-19 infection\r\nPRI provided the safety equipment for everyone involved, including special masks, safety gears, gloves that the prisoners will be wearing during the production phases of the gates\r\n\r\nOutput 2.2:\r\nTo make sure that individuals who come in contact with the law have the minima level of protection when they enter stations, and that police officers have the same level of protection and don’t fear the risk of spreading the infection to their families while they are on duty, PRI provided Hygienic supplies for the PSD including 175,800 disposable pairs of gloves, 46,000 reusable face masks, and 487,450 surgical face masks for the benefit of 13,320 officers working at 111 police stations, in addition to 420 officers working with Juveniles at 13 police stations and over 300,000 individuals who visited the police stations during the life of project. \r\nIn addition PRI run a sanitation campaign  inside all police stations in Jordan, and juvenile police stations, including at the pre-trial stage cells, which the detainees stay in during the investigation phases. \r\nThe launch took place in September with the participation of the representative of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherland. (See Annex No. 4) \r\n\r\nOutput 2.3: \r\nPRI launched the project in May 2020 in the presence of her excellency the ambassador of Netherlands in Jordan who provided 450 women prisoners with  hygienic materials in order to respond to their specific needs and protect their rights to health.\r\n400 pack of antibacterial wipes, 6750 pack of pads and 3270 soap bars were distributed. (See Annex No. 5)\r\n \r\nOutput 3.1: \r\nPRI  partnered with Siren to ensure that the role of Community police will still be active during the lockdown across the country. PRI   provided Siren with 100,000 disposable sanitized gloves and 10,000 reusable face mask  which were distributed to the community police to guarantee that the safety measures are maintained during the distribution of food parcels for families who are in need in North Amman within the One Body Community Initiative, Shoulder to Shoulder Project implemented by Siren. \r\n\r\nOutput 3.2: \r\nPRI in collaboration with the PSD produced a five minutes documentary showing the main measures, and practices made by the Public Security Directorate PSD and the Correctional, & Rehabilitation Centers CRCs, in responding to COVID-19 and the main lessons learnt during the process. The broadcast was published among different media channels, official TV, and social media platforms as part of  the project promotion, which in return increased the trust of the Jordanian community of the PSD measures taken to sustain access to justice and protect individual’s right to health. This guaranteed the visibility of the Dutch government contribution, and support to Jordanian population in fighting COVID-19. (See Annex No. 6) \r\n\r\nOutput 3.3: \r\nPRI organized a session with key personnel from the public security directorate, and some prisoners and other representatives of international NGOs, and prison directorate, during which,  the main project outcomes were presented including the main measures taken to respond for COVID-19 in Jordan within the security eco-system, and how those measures have contributed to enhancing access to justice and law enforcement rule in protecting the right to health during quarantine.', 'IV. Risks and bottlenecks \r\nRisks related to context:\r\nGovernmental well and priorities: PRI has ensured continuous communication channels with the PSD high officials  which enabled a smooth implementation of the project activities utilizing mutual efforts and resources, accordingly all the interventions were implemented in agreement  with the PSD priorities and the governmental regulations related to the defence orders.\r\nRisks related to programming:\r\nLack of social acceptance for behavioural change and responding for the health preventive measures by the prisoners or their relatives: PRI have designed the awareness campaigns and advocacy activities with relevance to the targeted audience needs and comprehension levels of the main preventatives measures regarding COVID-19, accordingly the awareness posters were designed with a very simple language along illustrative symbols of the actions to be taken. Also, women and children were not excluded as the design of the posters was gender sensitive, along a special design made for the children. \r\nRisks related to the organization: \r\nAnti-fraud and anti-corruption policy within the organization: PRI has adopted its’ bribery and an anti-corruption policy, including its’ various financial procedures and controls, during the implementation of the project activities, PRI has used its’ legal ways of providing financing to the partners in Jordan. Along to, ensuring the on-going monitoring mechanism, of resources and expenditures via budget financial controls.\r\nOrganization structure and culture: Penal Reform International is an international non-governmental organization working on penal and criminal justice reform worldwide.  PRI has regional offices and programmers in the Middle East and North Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Also, PRI work with partner organizations in other parts of Africa and, using a variety of approaches, on penal reform issues in Asia, North and Latin America and the Caribbean. PRI has Consultative Status with the United Nations (ECOSOC) and the Council of Europe, and Observer Status with the African Committee on the Right and Welfare of the Child, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. PRI is also a registered civil society organization with the Organization of American States (OAS).PRI works with governments, and civil society to improve conditions of detention.  PRI promotes greater transparency and accountability in the criminal justice and penal systems through holistic policy development and legal reform, including encouraging reform processes aimed at humanising juvenile justice, detention conditions and implementing rehabilitation programmes, the development and implementation of international human rights instruments in relation to law enforcement and prison conditions, the elimination of unfair and unethical discrimination in all penal measures. PRI’s work involves cooperation and collaboration with governments, other official authorities and non-governmental partners, which helps PRI, maintains impartiality, sustainability and builds trust with all of its partners.\r\nPRI covers the Middle East and North Africa region from its Jordan office. It has been working in this region for 14 years now, covering 13 countries.\r\n\r\nMonitoring, evaluation and management quality: PRI has developed a project monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) system to track the results of the project. The MEL system has included: A theory of change which shows the logical linkages and assumptions between the goal, results, outputs and activities.\r\nA monitoring framework with results statements, milestones, targets and identified data collection sources.  The project team have systematically collect data to track the indicators at outcome and output level utilizing various data collection tools and reporting templates.  \r\n\r\nFinancial and administrative management: As an international NGO with 30 years of history, PRI has well-established financial management mechanisms for its programmatic activity.  In the first instance, a day-to-day financial administration for the project has be undertaken by the MENA finance manager, with the oversight of the Project Manager.  The MENA finance manager has reported on a monthly basis to the Regional Director and Financial Director in London, who oversees the whole financial transactions of the MENA office. Monthly reports on the financial performance of the project has been submitted to PRI home office. These are checked against financial projections which are agreed between the London and Regional Offices at the commencement of any programme. \r\n Major changes to the spending of the project are discussed between the Financial Managers and the Regional Director. \r\n\r\n\r\nV. Sustainability:\r\n\r\nSelf-sufficiency approach and positive investment in the prisoners was utilized during the phases of the current project, which guarantees sustainability, as the relation between PRI, the PSD and CRC is not supplier to consumer relationship rather a supplier to supplier relationship, which means that PRI is not acting as a direct provider of technical services and logistical support for a final consumer institution, but rather for an institution which will act as a supplier of new products. And this is guaranteed, through the vocational and reintegration programs prompted inside the prisons. From that time onward ,the prisoners started manufacturing the needed Sterilization Machines, to be used for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in all the police stations and juvenile police department and CRCs all across Jordan.\r\n\r\nVisibility \r\nPRI has worked during the implementation of the project on guaranteeing the visibility of the donor, through continuous communication and coordination between the project manager and the embassy staff prior publishing or printing or distributing any materials to the public, either in a tangible and/or electronic format, and ensuring a  proper branding for the kingdom of Netherlands logo per the instructions and regulations embedded by the embassy.\r\nThis has covered the publications produced during the project timeline-(ex. The health protocol, Awareness Posters), and the digital outreach (ex.  PRI official Facebook page, local News channels, Radio Broadcasting), as well as the advocacy activities through the documentary produced in partnership with the PSD aiming at communicating the shared results and illustrating the impact of the contributions. In addition, all tangible aids provided for the PSD and CRCs were properly branded with the logo of the embassy including the sanitation gates, face masks and gloves packages, gender sensitive products packages, sanitizing products packages, COVID-19 medical apron packages.']",['PENAL REFORM INTERNATIONAL'],"['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Penal Reform International']",2c6d537aa60072464d4930f382f0459b,['Syria'],[],"['urban', 'rural']",['Jordan'],"['humanitarian', 'development']",['Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs'],"['PENAL REFORM INTERNATIONAL', 'Public Security Directorate', 'Correctional and Rehabilitation Centers', 'Siren']",2025-06-04T09:34:40.734551

The system frequently overflowed into city streets and the surrounding environment, relied on pump stations that had insufficient capacity, and did not serve nearly 30 percent of the population. The Wastewater Network Project represented the largest investment in wastewater infrastructure improvements for Zarqa Governorate system. The objectives of the project were to (i) increase access to the wastewater network, (ii) increase the volume of wastewater collected within Zarqa Governorate for treatment and reuse, and (iii) reduce the incidents of sewage overflow.\n\nThe Wastewater Network Project was originally comprised of two activities: (i) the reinforcement of existing networks and rehabilitation of existing sewer main lines in West Zarqa, and (ii) the reinforcement of existing networks and rehabilitation of existing sewer main lines in East Zarqa.\n\nThe project extended service to households that were not connected to the sewer network by constructing over 300 kilometers of new sewers in the neighborhoods of East Zarqa and West Zarqa, both of which lacked access to the sewer network. The extension of lateral sewer lines raised wastewater service coverage rates from 72 percent to about 84 percent of the local Jordanian population, though coverage rates of the full population dropped due to the influx of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. These new customer connections also generated additional wastewater. The project provided more than 8,700 connection points to the wastewater pipes, which allowed over 54,800 people to be connected to the new wastewater system. These new customer connections generated additional wastewater which is treated at the As-Samra Wastewater Treatment Plant and reused in agriculture downstream in the Jordan Valley. The project also utilized unused budget identified during implementation of the compact to add 65 kilometers of pipes to the Princess Haya neighborhood of the Zarqa Governorate and to purchase high pressure jet cleaning vehicles for the water utility to enhance system maintenance.']",['Millennium Challenge Corporation'],"['Millennium Challenge Corporation', 'Millennium Challenge Corporation', 'Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) - Jordan', 'Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) - Jordan', 'Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) - Jordan']",4379ed16a92db50bf822653fdbb36034,"['Syria', 'Iraq']",['general_population'],['urban'],"['Jordan', 'Zarqa Governorate', 'East Zarqa', 'West Zarqa', 'Jordan Valley']",['development'],['Millennium Challenge Corporation'],"['Millennium Challenge Corporation', 'Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) - Jordan']",2025-06-04T09:35:05.229187

It is evident that both the PPs and the Government of Jordan (GoJ) policies aim at revitalising the economy, strengthening good governance, promoting peace and security, strengthening fiscal stability and boosting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. The implementation of the foreseen structural and economic reforms requires knowledge transfer and harmonization of the domestic regulatory and policy frameworks with EU and international standards in order to be efficient, successful and sustained. This action will support the public sector institutions to develop and implement effective policy and regulatory frameworks that enable the implementation of the PPs. Given the magnitude of the protracted Syrian crises in Jordan, this action will support MoPIC in the management of the Jordan Response Plan (JRP). In this respect the program complements and builds synergies with relevant components of the Support to Livelihoods under the regional response to the Syrian crisis AAP equally presented in 2022.In addition, the implementation of the EU-Jordan PPs requires efficient, effective, and accountable public sector institutions. The quality, capability, and effectiveness of the Jordanian public sector are given special attention both in GIEP and the MIP, and have been prioritized by His Majesty King Abdullah II, in both his letter to the Jordanian people on the occasion of his 60th birthday, as well as in his letter of designation to Prime Minister (PM) Bisher Al Khasawneh. Accordingly, the GoJ has been taking serious steps towards modernising its public sector institutions which will be supported by this demand-driven Action. The main type of support under this Action will be the provision of capacity building and technical assistance to public institutions operating in all areas relevant to the Partnership Priorities, mainly through the EU¿s legacy institution building tool, the twinning modality. Special attention will be provided to the EU-Jordan Investment Platform which will be launched in June 2022.Recognizing the importance of strategic communications and public diplomacy in promoting EU values to Jordan (and therefore implementation of the PPs) and taking a ¿whole of delegation¿ approach, this Action will also support strategic communication initiatives to increase EU interventions visibility in Jordan, in addition to cultural exchange initiatives.

It is evident that both the PPs and the Government of Jordan (GoJ) policies aim at revitalising the economy, strengthening good governance, promoting peace and security, strengthening fiscal stability and boosting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. The implementation of the foreseen structural and economic reforms requires knowledge transfer and harmonization of the domestic regulatory and policy frameworks with EU and international standards in order to be efficient, successful and sustained. This action will support the public sector institutions to develop and implement effective policy and regulatory frameworks that enable the implementation of the PPs. Given the magnitude of the protracted Syrian crises in Jordan, this action will support MoPIC in the management of the Jordan Response Plan (JRP). In this respect the program complements and builds synergies with relevant components of the Support to Livelihoods under the regional response to the Syrian crisis AAP equally presented in 2022.In addition, the implementation of the EU-Jordan PPs requires efficient, effective, and accountable public sector institutions. The quality, capability, and effectiveness of the Jordanian public sector are given special attention both in GIEP and the MIP, and have been prioritized by His Majesty King Abdullah II, in both his letter to the Jordanian people on the occasion of his 60th birthday, as well as in his letter of designation to Prime Minister (PM) Bisher Al Khasawneh. Accordingly, the GoJ has been taking serious steps towards modernising its public sector institutions which will be supported by this demand-driven Action. The main type of support under this Action will be the provision of capacity building and technical assistance to public institutions operating in all areas relevant to the Partnership Priorities, mainly through the EU¿s legacy institution building tool, the twinning modality. Special attention will be provided to the EU-Jordan Investment Platform which will be launched in June 2022.Recognizing the importance of strategic communications and public diplomacy in promoting EU values to Jordan (and therefore implementation of the PPs) and taking a ¿whole of delegation¿ approach, this Action will also support strategic communication initiatives to increase EU interventions visibility in Jordan, in addition to cultural exchange initiatives.

It is evident that both the PPs and the Government of Jordan (GoJ) policies aim at revitalising the economy, strengthening good governance, promoting peace and security, strengthening fiscal stability and boosting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. The implementation of the foreseen structural and economic reforms requires knowledge transfer and harmonization of the domestic regulatory and policy frameworks with EU and international standards in order to be efficient, successful and sustained. This action will support the public sector institutions to develop and implement effective policy and regulatory frameworks that enable the implementation of the PPs. Given the magnitude of the protracted Syrian crises in Jordan, this action will support MoPIC in the management of the Jordan Response Plan (JRP). In this respect the program complements and builds synergies with relevant components of the Support to Livelihoods under the regional response to the Syrian crisis AAP equally presented in 2022.In addition, the implementation of the EU-Jordan PPs requires efficient, effective, and accountable public sector institutions. The quality, capability, and effectiveness of the Jordanian public sector are given special attention both in GIEP and the MIP, and have been prioritized by His Majesty King Abdullah II, in both his letter to the Jordanian people on the occasion of his 60th birthday, as well as in his letter of designation to Prime Minister (PM) Bisher Al Khasawneh. Accordingly, the GoJ has been taking serious steps towards modernising its public sector institutions which will be supported by this demand-driven Action. The main type of support under this Action will be the provision of capacity building and technical assistance to public institutions operating in all areas relevant to the Partnership Priorities, mainly through the EU¿s legacy institution building tool, the twinning modality. Special attention will be provided to the EU-Jordan Investment Platform which will be launched in June 2022.Recognizing the importance of strategic communications and public diplomacy in promoting EU values to Jordan (and therefore implementation of the PPs) and taking a ¿whole of delegation¿ approach, this Action will also support strategic communication initiatives to increase EU interventions visibility in Jordan, in addition to cultural exchange initiatives. This will allow the development of long-term strategic approaches that will foster and mobilise networks of target audiences (youth, academics, influencers, civil society and cultural actors).""]",['European Commission - Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations'],"['European Commission', 'Central Government', 'Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations']",fbd50935e8f65afa882f5dbdf08af609,['Syria'],['host_communities'],[],['Jordan'],"['humanitarian', 'development']","['European Commission', 'European Union']","['Central Government', 'Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations']",2025-06-04T09:37:18.830175

The majority of them are above the minimum age for employment, indicating that the main problem lies in the conditions of work and other worst forms that child labourers in the 16 to 18 age group suffer from. Given the low and perhaps manageable number of child labourers, Jordan could be one of the first countries to become child labour free if concerted efforts are made to reach even the hard-to-reach, ensure occupational safety for the above 16s and link the families of child labourers with social protection schemes of the State. This four-year project (2010 – 2014) will prepare the ground for the country to move towards this. It builds on the previous IPEC Action Programme and Country Programme (2002 – 2007) also supported by the US Department of Labor (USDOL) and complements other initiatives of the Government of Jordan and civil society aimed at reducing drop-out from basic education, improving working conditions for youth and eliminating child labour. In particular, it will build the capacity of the Child Labour Unit (CLU) of the Ministry of Labour (MoL) to coordinate the implementation of the National Framework on Child Labour (NFCL) being developed under the “Combating Exploitative Child Labor through Education” (CECLE) project. Since the NFCL is not yet available, this project document will be finalised after a meeting in March 2011 to be organized by USDOL that will bring together USDOL, USDOL’s various Jordan grantees (ILO, CECLE and the FY2010 Child Labour Elimination project grantee) and perhaps other relevant stakeholders to discuss the role of each entity in implementing the NFCL. Child Labour Situation Child labour in Jordan is mainly concentrated in the governorates of Amman, Zarka, Balqa and Irbid. Participants at the stakeholder workshop conducted on October 7, 2010 as a preparation for this proposal were also concerned about the increase in child labour linked to tourism in the region of Petra and among children living in certain refugee camps in the outskirts of Amman. All the surveys confirm that large family size, low levels of education of parents, and intergenerational poverty are the main causes of child labour. This is compounded by the difficulty that families of child labourers experience in accessing social support from the State. A paradox that is found in many countries is that child labour persists in the context of high rates of youth unemployment. In 2008, the unemployment rate in the 16 to 19 age group was as high as 32.8% against a general unemployment rate of 12.7% in that year. There is clearly a need to, on the one hand, reorient demand away from child labour towards youth and, on the other, to reduce the occupational risks that the 16 -18 age group faces by enforcing occupational safety and health (OSH) standards present in Jordanian labour law. No studies have been done so far on the worst forms of child labour (WFCL) other than hazardous work. The Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) on hazardous work indicated that 13% of working children are working against their will and recommended that priority be given to withdrawing them. The US Trafficking in Persons Report 2009 also refers to forced child labour stating that “Some Jordanian children employed within the country as street vendors, carpenters, painters, mechanics, domestics, restaurant staff, or agricultural labourers may be exploited in situations of forced labour.” Forced child labour is another area requiring further investigation and action. Legal and policy framework Jordan has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and ILO Convention No.s 138 (C138) and 182 (C182). As required by C138, Article 73 of the Jordanian Labour Law prohibits the employment of children under 16, the age under which schooling is compulsory.

The Government is currently keen to address the labour market challenges which have been exacerbated by the Syrian Refugee crisis and one way to do so is through expediting the NES implementation. Consequently, this project will implement two interrelated levels of interventions: expanding impact and strengthening policy coordination. 2. A National Apprenticeship System established- with upgraded informal apprenticeship practices for young Syrians There is a strong link between this proposal and the first phase of the SIDA funded project on youth employment: in the first phase, a successful pilot was undertaken to upgrade informal apprenticeships. It generated great interest from national stakeholders, who expressed commitment to partner with ILO for the improvement of their workplace based training programmes. In parallel, the design of an apprenticeship “tool kit” is well under way based on a review of international good practices. It includes detailed guidance on (a) possible legal and policy framework for an apprenticeship system, (b) a contract template based on ILS – being validated by NORMES, (c) social dialogue guidance for designing and managing apprenticeship systems, (d) one week modular course on pedagogical skills for master craft-persons – among other components.']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],450ac7c635d4cdda3883f691a278bed9,['Syria'],['refugees'],"['urban', 'rural']",['Jordan'],"['humanitarian', 'development']","['Sweden', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency']",['International Labour Organization (ILO)'],2025-06-04T09:37:56.817035

The resulting impoverished circumstances of many Syrian refugees are leading them to seek any form of income to provide for their families, which is further exacerbating tensions between host and migrant labour communities. Due to the lack of access to allowed formal jobs for parents and lack of vocational opportunities for Syrian adolescents, many households resort to child labour. Through this project funded by DANIDA, the ILO will contribute to the elimination of child labour, especially its worst forms, among Syrian refugees and host communities in Jordan and Lebanon.

The majority of them are above the minimum age for employment, indicating that the main problem lies in the conditions of work and other worst forms that child labourers in the 16 to 18 age group suffer from. Given the low and perhaps manageable number of child labourers, Jordan could be one of the first countries to become child labour free if concerted efforts are made to reach even the hard-to-reach, ensure occupational safety for the above 16s and link the families of child labourers with social protection schemes of the State. This four-year project (2010 – 2014) will prepare the ground for the country to move towards this. It builds on the previous IPEC Action Programme and Country Programme (2002 – 2007) also supported by the US Department of Labor (USDOL) and complements other initiatives of the Government of Jordan and civil society aimed at reducing drop-out from basic education, improving working conditions for youth and eliminating child labour. In particular, it will build the capacity of the Child Labour Unit (CLU) of the Ministry of Labour (MoL) to coordinate the implementation of the National Framework on Child Labour (NFCL) being developed under the “Combating Exploitative Child Labor through Education” (CECLE) project. Since the NFCL is not yet available, this project document will be finalised after a meeting in March 2011 to be organized by USDOL that will bring together USDOL, USDOL’s various Jordan grantees (ILO, CECLE and the FY2010 Child Labour Elimination project grantee) and perhaps other relevant stakeholders to discuss the role of each entity in implementing the NFCL. Child Labour Situation Child labour in Jordan is mainly concentrated in the governorates of Amman, Zarka, Balqa and Irbid. Participants at the stakeholder workshop conducted on October 7, 2010 as a preparation for this proposal were also concerned about the increase in child labour linked to tourism in the region of Petra and among children living in certain refugee camps in the outskirts of Amman. All the surveys confirm that large family size, low levels of education of parents, and intergenerational poverty are the main causes of child labour. This is compounded by the difficulty that families of child labourers experience in accessing social support from the State. A paradox that is found in many countries is that child labour persists in the context of high rates of youth unemployment. In 2008, the unemployment rate in the 16 to 19 age group was as high as 32.8% against a general unemployment rate of 12.7% in that year. There is clearly a need to, on the one hand, reorient demand away from child labour towards youth and, on the other, to reduce the occupational risks that the 16 -18 age group faces by enforcing occupational safety and health (OSH) standards present in Jordanian labour law. No studies have been done so far on the worst forms of child labour (WFCL) other than hazardous work. The Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) on hazardous work indicated that 13% of working children are working against their will and recommended that priority be given to withdrawing them. The US Trafficking in Persons Report 2009 also refers to forced child labour stating that “Some Jordanian children employed within the country as street vendors, carpenters, painters, mechanics, domestics, restaurant staff, or agricultural labourers may be exploited in situations of forced labour.” Forced child labour is another area requiring further investigation and action. Legal and policy framework Jordan has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and ILO Convention No.s 138 (C138) and 182 (C182). As required by C138, Article 73 of the Jordanian Labour Law prohibits the employment of children under 16, the age under which schooling is compulsory.

It has affected particularly the neighboring states. For example, Jordan currently hosts approximately 650 000 registered Syrian refugees, whilst total Syrian population in Jordan is estimated as 1.4 million.  Women are often among the vulnerable groups particularly affected by the Syrian crisis. According to a vulnerability mapping conducted by UN Women, situation for the Syrian refugee women is difficult, particularly to find employment. Some of the contributing factors include the current legislation and the low number of work permits for refugee women, the cultural norms, as well as lack of education possibilities for women. Women are also often more affected by gender-based violence. These same factors also affect the most vulnerable Jordanian women.  The fourth phase of the UN Women’s project Eid-bi-Eid supports the economic and social empowerment of the most vulnerable women. Beneficiaries include particularly the Syrian refugee women and the most vulnerable Jordanian women. The objective of the project is improve women’s rights, including livelihoods through:  1)\tSecure livelihoods opportunities provided via cash for work that graduates into sustainable employment opportunities whether through job placement, entrepreneurship, or work permit applications 2)\tGender based violence prevention, protection and awareness raising services 3)\tEducation opportunities linked to the labor market, leadership, and civic engagement initiatives for women, while also engaging men on social issues related to gender equality and women’s empowerment  The EBE4 project covers 2023-2026 and it is a multi-donor pooled fund. The project will have almost 50.000 direct beneficiaries. The overall budget of the project is around 35 million USD, of which Finland’s share is 2,1 million euros.  Finland has supported the three eariler phases of the project in 2014–2022, for 4.3 million euros. According to an evaluation reports in 2023 and 2019, the project has produced good results, and it has been relevant for promoting women’s economic empowerment. In the last phase the project had over 30.000 direct beneficiaries.', 'Syyrian yli 11 vuotta jatkunut kriisi on valtava humanitaarinen katastrofi, josta etenkin Syyrian naapurimaat kantavat seurauksia. Pelkästään Jordaniassa on noin 650 000 rekisteröityä syyrialaispakolaista ja kokonaisuudessaan Jordaniassa arvioidaan olevan 1 400 000 syyrialaista.   UN Womenin Eid-bi-Eid-hankkeen (suom. ”käsi kädessä”) 4. vaihe tukee etenkin haavoittuvassa asemassa olevien naisten taloudellista ja sosiaalista voimaantumista. Avunsaajia ovat etenkin syyrialaispakolaisnaiset ja heikoimmassa asemassa olevat jordanialaisnaiset. Hankkeen tavoite on tukea naisten työllistymistä:  1) turvaamalla elinkelpoisia mahdollisuuksia cash-for-work tehtävillä, jotka valmistavat kestäviin työllistymismahdollisuuksiin työpaikan löytämisen, yrittäjyyden ja työlupahakemusten myötä;  2) sukupuolittuneen väkivallan ehkäisyä, suojapalveluita ja tietoisuuden lisäämisen toimenpiteitä;  3) kouluttautumismahdollisuuksia, jotka liittyvät työmarkkinoihin, johtajuuteen ja kansalaisosallistumisen mahdollisuuksiin naisille, sekä sitouttaen miehiä sosiaalisissa asioissa jotka liittyvät sukupuolten tasa-arvoon ja naisten voimaannuttamiseen.  Suomi on rahoittanut hankkeen kolmea ensimmäistä vaihetta vuosina 2014–2022 yhteensä 4,3 MEUR:lla. UN Womenin vuoden 2022 Jordanian maaohjelman evaluaation löydöksissä cash-for-work-toimenpiteiden todettiin tarjoavan välitöntä lievennystä hyödynsaajille. Oasis-keskukset todettiin turva-alueiksi joissa haavoittuneessa asemassa olevat naiset saivat voimaantua, opiskella ja rakentaa yhteisötaitoja. Evaluaatiossa myös todettiin, ettei riittävää dataa ole tarjolla taitojen kehityksen ja työllistymisen suhteesta, jonka vuoksi UN Women on muuttanut projektin suunnitelmaa keskittymään pitkän aikavälin resilienssin rakentamiseen.  Suomen rahoitus hankkeen neljänteen vaiheeseen on 2,1 MEUR. Hanke rahoitetaan osaston vuoden 2023 maa- ja aluekohtaisen kehitysyhteisön määrärahoista (700 000 EUR) sekä osaston vuoden 2023 maa- ja aluekohtaisen kehitysyhteisön valtuuksista (v. 2024 700 000 EUR, v. 2025 700 000 EUR).']",['Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland'],"['Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland', 'United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women', 'YK:n tasa-arvojärjestö']",2a569f4d716e210247e7bb12947d8441,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",[],['Jordan'],"['humanitarian', 'development']",['Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland'],"['United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women', 'YK:n tasa-arvojärjestö']",2025-06-04T09:39:06.151180

The postnatal period is characterized by heightened vulnerability to both psychological and physiological illnesses among women.    \n\nThe project will integrate FP and MH interventions into existing immunization and postnatal care services to enhance the mental and reproductive health of migrant, refugee and underserved women in Jordan. It will identify and prioritize high-impact FP and MH interventions and assess the current state of MH services for postnatal women. Based on the findings, integrated FP and MH interventions will be co-designed and developed in collaboration with stakeholders.

While Jordan has made impressive strides in, for example, GYW’s access to education and the introduction of new laws against GBV, their socio-political participation continues to be much lower than that of boys and young men. Within the population of girls and young women (between age 14 till 24 years of age), there are specific groups of GYW in She Leads countries who suffer most from (intersectional) discrimination and exclusion.\nShe Leads is a joint programme of Plan International Netherlands, Defence for Children - ECPAT the Netherlands (DCI-ECPAT), African Women’s Development and Communication Network (FEMNET), and Terre des Hommes the Netherlands (TdH). Equal Measures 2030 is a technical partner. In Jordan, consortium members DCI-ECPAT, TdH and Plan will be implementing.', 'Girls and young women’s (GYW’s) rights to engage in public decision-making are enshrined in international agreements and national laws. In reality, however, GYW voices are excluded from the socio-political domain,  particularly those of GYW who experience intersecting forms of discrimination. \nGYW’s meaningful participation is obstructed by three interrelated factors. Firstly, discriminatory gender- and age-related social norms limit GYW’s rights to move freely, voice opinions and engage in public life. \nSecondly, GYW groups in civil society are under resourced and lack strong ties with more established CSOs. The latter are not always responsive to the specific needs and perspectives of GYW-led groups. Furthermore, the global phenomenon of shrinking civic space is affecting GYW-led organizations, making it even harder for them to express their opinions, assemble and associate. Groups that challenge the ruling gender ideology are increasingly being intimidated, threatened and exposed to violence. In conflict and humanitarian contexts, GYW actors risk additional security threats as easy targets of militarized and extremist forces. \nThirdly, political institutions at local and national level are dominated by elites consisting of mainly male, elder leaders, with no interest in institutional reforms that would make decision-making processes more inclusive, transparent and accountable. Existing consultation mechanisms (such as youth parliaments and advisory bodies) are usually poorly resourced, dependent on donor support and functioning irregularly.', 'She Leads envisions change in 3 domains of society: the social-cultural, civil society and institutional domain. In the social-cultural domain, partners engage traditional and religious leaders, forging coalitions of progressive actors who, due to their status and authority, will galvanize their constituencies to adopt more positive gender and age norms. Awareness raising and diffusion of new ideas through media and peer networks (including boys and young men) will challenge existing norms and expectations. Young female activists play an important role in this process, by inspiring other girls and breaking down negative stereotypes. \nIn the civil society domain, the creation (consolidation) of safe spaces in which  GYW can meet, exchange, build their confidence, political consciousness and skills, is a major step towards increased self-organization. Another key condition is the increased capacity of (adult-led) CSOs to effectively support GYW collective action. Stronger collaboration between GYW groups, child and women’s rights networks will lead to a more enabling environment for GYW-led groups. A well connected and better resourced social movement for girls’ rights is able to promote a strong feminist counternarrative to the dominant patriarchal and ageist ideology. \nIn the institutional domain, policy makers will develop greater  awareness and knowledge about GYW inclusion in decision-making. Stronger connections between progressive policy makers and political leaders working at different levels will result in a coalition of reform-minded champions. In addition, pressure exercised by regional and international  bodies will force national governments to take action and safeguard GYW’s rights to association and freedom of expression.', 'Currently we are witnessing a rise in girls and young women’s activism and protest. The She Leads programme will partner with existing GYW-led groups and feminist organizations. Importantly, special efforts are made to support existing informal groups of girls and young women, for example girls clubs, associations, student groups and unregistered organizations, which have started to organize and mobilize but are often excluded from many funding mechanisms.\n\nIn the African She Leads countries, the programme builds directly on the experiences of the previous Girls Advocacy Alliance (2016-2020). \n\nDCI-ECPAT is a network organisation, and will be working through selected members of their respective networks. Plan International and Terre des Hommes will work through their country offices and with local contracted organisations to implement projects under the overall She Leads programme. \n\nFinally, She Leads will seek alignment and collaboration with the Dutch Embassy and other consortiums funded under the Strengthening Civil Society framework of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation. In particular, She Leads will seek alignment with the four other consortiums funded under the Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (WRGE) theme of the Power of Voices funding mechanism.', 'Within the population of girls and young women (between 14 till 24 years), the programme aims to strengthen the influence and participation of GYW who suffer most from (intersectional) discrimination and exclusion. These include:\n•\tGYW living in poor, remote rural areas and urban slums\n•\tGYW experiencing gender based violence (particularly girls who have married early)\n•\tGYW with disabilities\n•\tGYW who are out of school\n•\tRefugee and internally displaced GYW\n•\tGYW from sexual minority groups', 'She Leads contributes to a lasting transformative effect on engagement of GYW in decision-making. The following strategies will be implemented: \n\n1.\tStrengthening and resourcing GYW-led organizations: investing in the resource base of GYW-led organizations will help them access other funding in the future. \n2.\tSupport social movements: social movements can accelerate lasting change in societies’ structures and norms. She Leads will bring together child-rights and feminist organisations and GYW-led groups to push collectively for transformative change in gender norms, and for institutional reform. \n3.\tEngaging boys & men, parents, and traditional and religious leaders: these actors are crucial allies to ensure structural change and permanent effects when it comes to norms change. Because of their status and their role in socialisation processes, these actors promote structural change in societies. \n4.\tEngaging media: She Leads will use media as a tool to amplify GYWs voices, and will target media as a powerful agent of change. Opening space for GYW’s voices and leadership in the media will ultimately influence broader communities, and has lasting effects beyond the programme.\n5.\tOrganisational capacity strengthening of CSO’s: investments in advocacy capacity, building relationships with decision-makers, strengthening fundraising skills will have a lasting effect on their influencing work beyond She Leads. \n6.\tLinking local, national, regional and global: She Leads is implemented at different levels that are strategically interconnected.

Its goal is for children under five years, born into vulnerable and marginalised households, receive the care, nurture and support services they need for healthy growth development to reach their full potential, free from harmful gendered norms and attitudes that are discriminatory and limiting. In order to achieve the this, the programme adopts two pathways that ensure parents and caregivers practice gender transformative and age appropriate non-violent parenting behaviours, and that Early Children Development becomes an integrated and comprehensive national priority in Jordan. It will be implemented across 15 Mother and Child Centres targeting 2,225 parents and 100 frontline staff implemented by Plan International and local partners. It is supported by a behavioural science research to capture best practices.', 'Early childhood development creates a lasting impact on a child’s future outcomes as it lays the foundation for future wellbeing and resilience. Children living in poverty, social exclusion or affected by conflict often lack access to a safe, nurturing and supportive environment in which to grow. Evidence shows that parents living under such hardship have a particularly difficult time spending the mental energy required to provide ECD for their children. With the onset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, Jordan’s national social welfare systems and resources became severely strained and unable to meet the demand of new arrivals. Children account for 66% of the population and are impacted by poverty more than other age group. UNICEF observed that evidence required to monitor the development of children in Jordan needs improvement with inadequate data to inform policy and implementation of social services for children. Therefore we will support the National ECD Team to focus on this gap. Parenting programmes will be installed within health centres to reach more parents on the importance of ECD and positive parenting.', 'Our primary investment objective is to effectively support parents and caregivers to be more responsive and empowered to nurture children in an safe, enabling environment where ECD services are integrated across service providers and sectors to become a national priority. To create access to quality ECD services and for ECD to be prioritised, demand needs to be generated bottom up from parents/ caregivers as well as supported top down. By advancing postive parenting across multiple government bodies this project ensures that children are more effectively nurtured and parents are enabled to better support children’s developmental milestones and protect child’s rights. \nWe will roll out the parenting model by year three in 15 health centres across Jordan. These centres have been selected in collaboration with government and partner organisations based on a mapping of all 600 health centres, and a criteria for population diversity, and number of persons in the health centre catchment. We will conduct behavioural science research to investiagte the most effective and impactful approaches to integrate into our parenting currculum and mode of delivery and outreach.', '13% of children aged 36-59 months are attending ECD programs, compared to 22% in 2012 in Jordan. There are significant shortcomings in access, participation and quality of current ECD provision according to a recent HRD report. To address these gaps and build on lessons learned, Plan International is implementing a follow-on project that builds on the first 2-year project by scaling-up parenting services to 15 health centres, continued engagement in national policy change through the ECD Team. This project empowers parents through community-based approaches to learning to create a more nurturing home environment to better respond to children’s needs without gender discrimination or violence. It will use a revised parenting curriculum with lessons learned from past programming pulling on ECD theory, psychosocial support for parents and violence prevention, as well as gender transformative learning. While in parallel enacting structures within the national architecture to sustain policy level changes to integrate ECD as a comprehensive approach to the care for young children. Through strategic alliances with the Jordanian Ministry of Health and Education, national CBOs and NGOs as well as UNICEF Jordan.', 'Caregivers of young children from vulnerable backgrounds e.g. refugees, asylum seekers, families living in poverty or affected by other discrimination prohibiting  integration into the community. ECD services for children under 6 years old will be provided. Finally adult professionals at the Ministry of Health, Education and MOH centres.', 'In year one the project will focus on capacity building for the local partners, especially the ROYAL HEALTH AWARENESS SOCIETY (RHAS) who will take over responsibility for implementing the parenting package inside the MOH health centres nation wide. As such the first 6 months is an inception phase focussed on planning, training, mapping and preparing the teams to deliver quality programming to the most in need communities. Further, we will be adapting our parenting curriculum to reflect the most up-to-date guidance from global leaders in ECD and to reflect best practices from the first project. This will be done in consultation with partners, stakeholders and UNICEF. \n\nDuring this time, our behavioural science research partner will conduct background research and scoping of the problems related to poor positive parenting update among marginalised groups in Jordan. Additionally, the National ECD Team will resume activities and begin to make strides in order to prioritise ECD at the national level across all sectors. Due to the focus on COVID-19 response and resources demanded led by the MOH our main stakeholder, there has been a negative shift in focus from the previous project cycle away from ECD to prioritise the public health emergency. Therefore it is essential to maintain visibility among ministerial partners of the long term importance to focus on ECD for young children. \n\nFrom January, we will begin service delivery either via an online platform, or in person workshops with parents and caregivers depending on the current covid-19 movement restrictions and ensuring the safety of the community is at the forefront. Our curriculum will be digitalise to ensure easy adaptation based on the operational context ensure the safety of the most vulnerable is always prioritised. This will be closely followed by behavioural science specialists to support, track and monitor the uptake and impact n order to learn and adapt the approach as needed.', 'Plan focuses on building human and social capital as it is integral to strategic community investment; it leverages and multiplies the impact of the intervention by strengthening local partner organizations, increasing the likelihood of project success and sustainability. Plan has focused part of its intervention in government-run health centres instead of stand alone sites to increase the likelihood that the MOH can integrate this approach into their core functionality in the long term. Working hand in hand with MOH staff and through local partners already well integrated into the national systems, Plan International will provide capacity building and training opportunities for health and education staff ECD, psychosocial support, refugee and migrant rights, child protection identification and referral.

The goals are poverty reduction and social inclusion of disadvantaged and marginalized groups - particularly girls/women - through their integration into the formal economy.\nThe project has a strong focus on strengthening existing SEs/SEIS and social entrepreneurship support structures. Thus creating an enabling environment that allows the SE eco-system to start-up, scale up, and flourish. Growth and acceleration of existing high potential SEs/SEIs is a precondition to contribute to tangible socio-economic improvements for the most marginalized groups. The most notable effects are formal job creation, social innovation and social impact and for strengthening the national SE ecosystem in the long run.', 'Although Jordan is doing better than several of its neighbours in terms of human development, ranking 86 on the Human Development Index (2016), the country still faces a number of socio-economic devel-opment challenges, including a low economic growth, and an unemployment rate of  18,4 %. These challenges are particularly prevalent in the marginalized and remote areas such as Tafilleh and Ajloun, and in pockets of Amman. The ability of Jordan’s government to improve the poor socio-economic situa-tion of its citizens is further strained by the recent influx of refugees from especially Syria. This in addi-tion to an already large population of displaced Palestinians who are living in what has turned into semi-permanent settlements, especially in Amman, Zarqa and Irbid Governorate. In the education sector, youth skills are not aligned with labour market demands/lack of entrepreneurial culture among youth & in education system. The schooling system is under serious strain from the Syrian refugee crisis. More generally, due to retrenchment of the public sector, service provision in key social sectors such as edu-cation, health and the environment is falling short. Vulnerable communities have to fend for themselves. SEs and entrepreneurship in general have a high potential for job creation, but entrepreneurial activity remains at low levels. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) survey and the Total early stage Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) index, Jordan is ranking amongst the lowest countries (the 46th position out of 65). Especially regarding the start-up of new business ventures. Since there is no legal categorisation for SEs, they are registered either as CBOs or private businesses which generates fiscal issues, reluctance among credit suppliers and service providers to cooperate and in general a low status of SEs.  \nThe country’s youth and women, especially those living in the most disadvantaged communities, are disproportionately affected by the lack of economic opportunities. The national youth unemployment rate is hovering at 33%, while for university graduates it is estimated to be at least 16.7% (AlNasser 2016). Young Jordanians in other words struggle to find decent work which can sustain their livelihoods. The employment rate in the informal sector is rated at more than 50% (ILO, 2015) mostly consisting of low income, unskilled labour, lacking any legal protection. Women, especially young women, are particularly disadvantaged in the labour force and face issues, including discrimination, harassment and cultural barriers to access the job market. Entrenched gender norms position women and girls in an inferior position compared to boys, and girls from especially poor and rural households are discouraged from participating in civic and economic activities. Jordan ranks 135 out of 144 countries worldwide on the global index on gender equality, and for women economic participation Jordan ranks even lower, 138 out of 144 (GGGI, 2017). \nFollowing the Arab Spring, it was expected that youth across the region would start to be included in decision making processes and the hope was that this could lead to greater socio-economic inclusion. However, this is hampered due to intergenerational conflict among youth and adults, low capacity of decision makers to engage meaningfully with youth; the power dynamics within the local structures which favour the participation of those with connections inside those structures and gender inequalities and norms; \nSEs/SEIs are increasingly seen as having the potential to attain sustainable development in Jordan and to create new job opportunities, yet SEs/SEIs are constraint to develop to their full potential: Jordan lacks laws and regulations for social enterprises, hampering registration and complicating access to national and international funding. Due to their unclear status, private sector and service providers are reluctant to cooperate with SEs/SEIs. Moreover, while some SEs are finding ways to navigate a restric-tive and unconducive environment, they often lack the capacity and support structures to accelerate their enterprises and make them socially inclusive and sustainable. The typical social entrepreneur tends to be young (under 35), ambitious, and male and coming from predominantly middle to upper so-cioeconomic backgrounds (Halabi et. al 2017).  SEs often fail to attract, mobilize and include youth and women from marginalised areas, who therefore are not convinced of the value of social enterprises and their capacity to influence change whether at the local or national levels. Accor-dingly, youth from mar-ginalised areas tend to refrain from participating within them and create their own spaces instead –mostly informal groups. However, in reality this is still quiet challenging, as they are not recognized by the law and accordingly they cannot receive funds to have their capacity built and implement their own initiatives.', 'By strengthening at least 1 existing facility in each governorate to function as SE Support Centre as well as incubator for SE support activities, exchanges and events (OP1.1), the action will build the capacity of  existing SEs and SEIs to accelerate growth and contribute to tangible socio-economic improvements for the most marginalized groups, most notably formal job creation, social innovation and social impact. To do so the action will first assess the SE support structures in East Amman, Tafilleh, Ajloun and based on the assessment at least 3 SE support structures will be strengthened through the establishment of a physical space (SE Support Centres) in each of the target areas. Additionally, multiple service providers will be linked to these SE Support Centres to provide needs based technical, financial, public, entrepreneurial support to the SE/SEIs, with a priority for youth-led and women-led SE/SEIs. Conferences and events will be held for SE/SEIs to raise awareness among SE/SEIs and the community around this action and identify which support is required to accelerate existing SE/SEIs, and assess what is needed to ensure the inclusion of the most marginalized groups as women and youth, either as youth-and women-led SE/SEIs. Additionally, we will identify through an assessment which (especially youth and women led) 70 SE/SEIs have high potential to sustain, scale, and flourish to be supported with the sub granting scheme. This will lead to the identification and support of 40-60 SEs/SEIs through sub-grants (OP1.2). A sub-grant scheme will be developed based upon the partners sub granting experiences and these sub-grants will be awarded through a competitive process, with start-up grants given to SEIs and accelerator grants for scale-up more advanced SEs. Once the sub-grants have been provided the capacity of the selected 40-60 SEs/SEIs will be strengthened to create jobs for youth and women in particular, to become financially sustainable and competitive, and to translate social needs into business cases (OP1.3). This will be realized through the collaboration and support of all SE stakeholders in the action and experts in the SE support structures. The trainings of each SE/SEI will consist of 7-8 training sessions, on different topics, based on their needs, and in total around 120-180 participants will be participating in these trainings and further coached throughout the sub-grant cycle. Impact: These 3 outputs will create more sustainable and inclusive SE/SEIs in Jordan. Their success can be an example for other SE/SEIs, it will make other marginalized youth and women aware of the job opportunities which are available through SEs and social innovation, but also showing the social impact of the activities. It will create and support new SE/SEIs and provides jobs for the most marginalized and disadvantaged youth and women. This is how the action will lead to the acceleration of existing SE/SEIs and as a snow ball effect, it will create new SE/SEIs contributing to tangible socio-economic improvements of the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups in Jordan.\nBy establishing a national SE platform (“Jordan Social Enterprise Initiative”) (OP2.1) for peer-to-peer learning, networking, experience sharing and best practice dissemination, where all actors in the SE ecosystem in Jordan will be linked to each other and to their counterparts in Europe and the MENA region, the action will create a solid foundation for the SE eco-system to develop, scale and flourish. Through the engagement of the consortium partners, especially Alfanar and Euricse, the action will link the SE ecosystems in the MENA region and Europe to the eco-system in Jordan. A national SE platform will be established during a founding conference acting as the central unit to strengthen the eco-system in Jordan. Annually 2-3 conferences and seminars will be organised by the platform with the participating SE/SEIs in the action and other relevant SE stakeholders (in Jordan, MENA and Europe) to share peer-to-peer learnings and disseminate best practices. An advisory panel will be established consisting of technical, financial, SE experts, relevant authorities including our consortium partners. The aim of the panel will be twofold: 1) To provide high level technical advice on SE development taking into account the legal, policy, political and economic context, and 2) to engage authorities, business, social entrepreneurs, finance institutes and financiers to increase awareness of the impact that SEs can have as a driver for inclusive growth. This will result in strengthened capacity of relevant authorities to facilitate the development of the SE ecosystem and easier access to effective SE support services, based on international good practices for SE development adjusted to the Jordanian context (OP2.2).', 'The project is relevant to a number of policies in Jordan. It specifically contributes to the recent Jordan Economic Plan 2018-2020 as the action is aiming to foster job creation and income generation through the support of start-up businesses and expanding existing ones, promoting the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation across different economic sectors, age groups, providing consultation services to enhance productivity and competiveness and access to financing. Additionally, the government of Jordan Youth and Employment strategies and policies has prioritized the encouragement of young entrepreneurs, which besides women entrepreneurs is the most important target group of this action. A very important target group as the National Strategy for Entrepreneurship Development and SME Growth (2015-2019) highlighted that young entrepreneurs make up only 10.2% of enterprise owners. Women entrepreneurship is another Government priority and priority of the action, as women participation to the labour market is less than 14%. In line with the Jordan Vision 2025, the action creates concrete linkages with priority sectors and themes of the CfP by awarding sub-grants to SEs/SEIs that propose projects focusing on for instance education/TVET, employment, environment or public private participation (PPP). The action builds on global efforts to enhance economic development, Goal 8 of the Sustainable Development Goals (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and on the Jordan Compact, now being implemented, representing new commitments to expand access to markets, open up investment opportunities, create the institutional frameworks necessary for the private sector to thrive.Social enterprises in Jordan have high potential to create inclusive growth, innovation and social impact, yet many SEs and SEIs lack capacity and support structures to start-up, scale and flourish. This action builds on current and past experiences of the consortium partners on social enterprise development and economic empowerment of women and youth in Jordan, the MENA region and Europe. In preparation of the action, a mapping of SEs and support structures was carried out, and consultations with successful SEs and government stakeholders informed the design. During a design workshop in Amman with consortium partners and SE representatives the framework of the action was agreed upon. The action is based on Plan’s long track record in youth economic and women empowerment and in specific Plan’s experience to enhance employment for vulnerable young men and women confined in the informal economy. The co-applicants, Ruwwad and Alfanar bring in strong experience in supporting community-based and youth-led social enterprise initiatives, and the action draws on Alfanar’s ASSET model for capacity building and acceleration of SEs in the MENA region. Euricse’s expertise in supporting SE ecosystems in Europe provided strong basis to this action in terms of SE support structures and on policy and institutional frameworks.', '14,400 disadvantaged youth (aged 18-35), women working in the in-formal economy and other marginalised groups from the poorest communities in East Amman, Tafilleh and Ajloun will benefit from the strengthened SEs. 307,075 people will benefit from the platform ac-tivities.', 'To ensure the full potential of SE/SEIs in Jordan, as key contributor to tangible socio-economic im-provements for the most marginalised groups, the action is designed with a strong focus on growth and acceleration of existing high potential SEs and SEIs (SO1) and strengthening the national SE ecosys-tem (SO2). To accelerate existing SEs and SEIs in East Amman, Tafilleh and Ajloun, a key outcome is strengthening the capacity of SE/SEIs. The SE/SEIs will be strengthened in two ways, namely by provi-sion of sub-grants through a competitive call for proposals and capacity building support. The SE/SEIs selected for a sub-grant will be provided with tailor made trainings and extensive coaching and mentor-ing during the implementation of the sub-grant. The capacity and quality of SE/SEIs is also enhanced by making SE Support Centres available to them. These centres will be set up in such a way that SE/SEIs are linked to information-and key resources. Also, In order to have a sustainable and broader impact, the action will contribute to the establishment of the “Jordan Social Enterprise Initiative”. A national plat-form, organizing conferences with key stakeholders, including SE/SEIs, followed by the identification of networking, learning and experience sharing events and activities. Ultimately this will lead to the dis-semination of good practices and recommendations for further improvement of the national SE ecosys-tem. In order to take lessons and experiences of the MENA region and Europe into account as well, an advisory panel, consisting of national, regional and global experts, will be established. In collaboration with relevant authorities an appraisal of the national SE ecosystem and a forecast will be developed to further strengthen the ecosystem up till 2030. Based on these concrete recommendations for relevant changes to the policy and institutional framework for SEs in Jordan will be made. The outcomes will be shared with key government actors in order to influence the policy framework on SE in Jordan. This will lead to strengthened capacity of relevant authorities to facilitate the development of the SE eco-system and easier access to effective SE support services, based on international good practices for SE devel-opment adjusted to the Jordanian context.', 'At technical level the action is expected to have a direct impact on the capacity of 40-60 SEs/SEIs operating in East Amman, Tafilleh and Ajloun as well as a wider section of Jordanian SEs/SEIs benefitting from an improved SE eco-system with better coordination and learning. SEs/SEIs will become financially sustainable and competitive and will be better able to translate social needs (particular job creation and skill development) into financially sustainable business cases. The SEs/SEIs will have ability to engage in productive dialogue and collaboration with both their target communities and public and private sector stakeholders. Furthermore, the action will also strengthen existing SE support structures. Some directly as they will become SE Support Centers and some indirectly as they will benefit from the improvements in the eco-system and better coordination and learning.  \n\nAt economic level the action is expected to have a direct impact for 14,400 marginalised youth and women and their family members as they will access employment/self-employment, benefit from social services and develop the needed skills for inclusion in the formal economies. Access to employment or self-employment will increase income levels at individual and household level. Secondly, the action’s focus on building partnerships with private sector actors at national, MENA and European level is expected to create/ open up new markets to private enterprises operating in the target areas creating employment opportunities, social inclusion and economic growth. Finally, Ruwwad – and in extension Wamda Capital – are central actors in the ecosystem, will mobilise their networks to create linkages between investors and communities thus attracting further investments to SEs/SEIs.\n\nAt social level the action is expected to benefit 307,075 disadvantaged and marginalised people (youth, women, PWD and refugees) especially living in marginalised communities in East Amman, Tafilleh and Ajloun, as well as authorities, and all relevant SE stakeholders in Jordan, MENA Region, Europe. In addition to the raised income levels and inclusion in the formal economy the activities of the SEs/SEIs will deliver other tangible socio-economic improvements such as environmental (cleaner environment), health related or socially. \n\nAt policy level, the action will increase the awareness of representatives of the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Social Development, and the Ministry of Labour on the potential impact, characteristics and needs of SEs/SEIs. The engagement of authorities in key activities, including the national JSEI platform, the Advisory Panel and the participatory appraisal will enhance the development of the SE ecosystem and will contribute to improvements in the legislative and policy framework for SEs/SEIs. All of these activities aim to ensure a high level of engagement of authorities by creating networking opportunities with other ecosystem actors in the MENA region and Europe, allowing platform actors to learn how to improve the legal and fiscal framework and policies.']",['Plan International Netherlands'],"['Plan International Jordan', 'Plan International Netherlands', 'Plan International Netherlands', 'Save the Children Sweden']",49c7b1a7111b7b93aea69bbd63b699dd,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Jordan', 'Tafilleh', 'Ajloun', 'Amman', 'East Amman']",['development'],['Plan International Netherlands'],"['Plan International Jordan', 'Plan International Netherlands', 'Alfanar', 'EURICSE', 'Ruwwad', 'Save the Children Sweden']",2025-06-04T09:40:25.236534

Refugees with disabilities are paying the most striking consequences of the Syrian conflict, since they are likely to be cut off from the humanitarian response, especially as long as their disability is not enough taken into account in the planning and implementation of relief activities.  People with Disabilities should instead be integrated into any intervention and strategy and humanitarian aid should align with the principle of integrated programming (mainstreaming) and reach all the beneficiaries in need, especially the most vulnerable.Currently, several key humanitarian actors have shown to be very sensitive in this regard, and in some cases, has also proven a significant knowledge on disability issues. In this respect, UNHCR and Handicap International are committed to founding, supporting and coordinating the Disability Task Force (DTF), which brings together international and local NGOs as well as UN Agencies. The DTF aims at playing a leading role in mainstreaming disability in humanitarian programmes.While developing some useful operational tools and engaging regularly in meetings, the DTF has not yet had an impact on the policies and strategies of humanitarian organisations. In addition, the humanitarian response is still too focused on a medical approach, and remains very poor on human rights aspects, with almost no involvement of people with disabilities in the decision-making process.Therefore, this project proposal aims at enhancing the capacity of the main humanitarian actors and the DTF, to   mainstream disability since the very relief phase, and to involve persons with disabilities in identification, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. It aims also at stimulating the adoption of a human rights approach and participative methods, as the Emancipatory Research).Besides that, taking into consideration the host population, and in particular the most vulnerable sections of Jordanian citizens, the extra-vulnerable persons are around 2,000 people with disabilities who are still segregated in specialized institutes. This category, along with refugees with disabilities, share isolation and marginalization.However, thanks to the new and innovative law 20/2017, in line with the CRPD, the Jordanian Government has just started a process that will not only improve the condition of all disabled jordan citizens, in a real and concrete way through different action plans, but will remove from the institutions all Disabled People. For this purpose, the National Action Plan for Deinstitutionalization will be elaborated and implemented under  the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD). This project proposal also aims at supporting the MoSD and the Deinstitutionalization Committee to launch the Plan’s elaboration process. The active participation of People with Disabilities will be crucial in all programme activities and a scheme consisting of training and technical assistance will be developed.', ""In Giordania, Paese di 9,5 milioni di abitanti , il 31% della popolazione è straniera. Fra questi, la maggioranza è costituita da rifugiati. Secondo il Censimento del 2015, la Giordania ospita attualmente 1,3 milioni di siriani che vivono con maggior concentrazione nella provincia di Amman e nei due principali campi rifugiati ufficiali, Za’atari ed Azraq, che ospitano circa 116.000 persone.  Fra i rifugiati siriani registrati (circa 654.000), secondo UNHCR il 3,1% sono persone con disabilità; secondo studi paralleli realizzati da ONG  invece, circa il 30% di essi hanno bisogni speciali. Inoltre, almeno il 93% dei rifugiati siriani vive sotto il livello di povertà, avendo quindi serie difficoltà a soddisfare i bisogni primari (accesso ai servizi sanitari, alloggio, cibo).  Al contempo, i bisogni dei cittadini giordani sono cresciuti in parallelo alla competizione con la popolazione rifugiata per l’accesso alle risorse e alle difficoltà del governo di far fronte a queste esigenze, creando tensione fra le popolazioni. In questo contesto, l’isolamento e la segregazione contraddistinguono le Persone con Disabilità (PcD) ricoverate in istituti in maniera permanente in Giordania.  L’iniziativa va dunque verso la direzione di favorire un approccio globale, in linea con il documento della EU “Force displacement and development” del 2016 mirante a stimolare la realizzazione di azioni tese a favorire a protezione delle persone con disabilità e la promozione della loro autonomia in contesti di emergenza e di istituzionalizzazione, in collaborazione tra gli attori politici dello sviluppo e gli attori umanitari, per una migliore condivisione delle responsabilità e pianificazione degli interventi. Tale approccio prevede la realizzazione di azioni più efficaci e durevoli in grado di offrire alle PcD che vivono nei campi profughi una vita dignitosa, riducendo al contempo l'impatto sulle comunità di accoglienza.""]",['AICS - Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development'],"['AICS - Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development', 'AICS - Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development', 'AICS - Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development']",9a7e31e0d09dad4092e843a4fb62ec3b,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",['camp'],"['Jordan', 'Amman', 'Za’atari', 'Azraq']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['AICS - Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development'],['AICS - Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development'],2025-06-04T09:41:25.607973

PRS households where the head of family does not hold a Jordanian document receive US$ 40 per person per month, while PRS belonging to families where the head of household holds Jordanian documents, and who are hence more likely to have access to public services and other entitlements for Jordanian citizens, receive US$ 25 per person per month. Some 460 PRS and 152 Syrian refugees in King Abdullah Park (KAP), who are considered extremely vulnerable, will also continue to receive regular cash assistance. In 2021, to further support the resilience of PRS families, UNRWA will continue to provide a one-off emergency cash assistance with an average value of US$ 200. This support will be provided to an estimated 700 PRS families who experience a major shock or a crisis with distressing consequences on their economic situation. In 2021, UNRWA expects that more families will need this assistance due to the additional shocks created by COVID-19 and has increased the planned caseload from 2020 (passing from 450 families in 2020 to 700 in 2021). During the last quarter of 2021, winterization assistance will also be provided to all PRS. This assistance is provided based on family size, with families receiving between US$ 277 and US$ 453 depending on the number of members.

According to the 2019 Winterization Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) conducted in the first quarter of 2020, 82 per cent of respondents reported that winterization assistance helped them to cope with the harsh winter season. To mitigate the additional socioeconomic hardship created by COVID-19, UNRWA will complement the regular assistance provided to PRS with two rounds of COVID-19 top-up cash assistance of US$ 100 per person per round for all PRS in Jordan, including those in KAP. According to the PDM conducted in September 2020, 30 per cent of respondents confirmed that the COVID-19 cash assistance provided by UNRWA was enough to cover their basic food and NFI needs. 56.7 per cent stated that the cash assistance had moderately helped to improve their living conditions post COVID-19 lockdown; and 59.2 per cent confirmed that the cash assistance had moderately reduced their financial burden. In 2021, UNRWA will also distribute cash assistance to the most vulnerable ex-Gazans and PRI who are struggling with the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19 and who do not have access to the social safety net services provided by the government.

With diverse communities settling into its dense urban fabric over the centuries, Al-Salt’s public spaces have been the link between homes, religions, and cultures and have preserved the culture of hospitality and tolerance in a melting pot. The socio-cultural architectural and urban attributes of the city make it a unique example of a living heritage with a strong link between intangible attributes (tolerance and co-habitation; urban hospitality and urban social welfare; unique craftsmanship) and tangible attributes (significant built heritage and the urban setting). However, these public spaces that have played such an important role in supporting this culture of tolerance, intangible heritage, and social cohesion are currently suffering from several issues, as drainage problems, vandalism, exposed pipes and wires, and damaged surfaces, to name a few. The integrity of Al-Salt is vulnerable, and the rehabilitation and conservation of these spaces and their related living heritage assets are necessary to maintain the hospitable urban fabric. Yet, as the city continues to grow amid evolving challenges, such as a pandemic, the influx of refugees, rising unemployment, and the effects of climate change, public spaces have never been so vital and yet so neglected in upholding the integrity and social cohesion of this historically and culturally significant city. Also to be considered is the growth in tourism since the WH inscription, which constitutes a challenge as well as an opportunity, adding stress to an already densely populated city which the urban spaces can help ease, while at the same time supporting local economic development, which benefits from the valorisation of ICH.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this project aims to enhance the social cohesion, increase the livelihood opportunities, and maintain the integrity of Al-Salt city through the rehabilitation of safe, inclusive, and accessible green public spaces, the development of a city-wide public space strategy, as well as the documentation, promotion, and valorization of living heritage assets within Al-Salt Municipality. The project adopts a multi-dimensional approach that is informed by the urban development pressures and challenges that threaten the vulnerable sustainability, authenticity, and cohesion of the urban fabric of Al-Salt city. The rehabilitated spaces will provide the necessary platforms to facilitate marketplaces and economic exchange to improve the socioeconomic conditions of vulnerable communities in Al-Salt.']","['United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)', ""Organisation des Nations unies pour l'éducation, la science et la culture (UNESCO)""]","['United Nations Human Settlements Programme', 'UNHABITAT']",6eb773c651a617c2ae6c0f510cdba21b,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",['urban'],['Al-Salt Municipality'],['development'],[],"['United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)', ""Organisation des Nations unies pour l'éducation, la science et la culture (UNESCO)"", 'United Nations Human Settlements Programme', 'UNHABITAT']",2025-06-04T09:49:27.478959

As a result, for example, 300 million m³ of desalinated seawater will be transported from Aqaba to Amman in an energy-intensive manner via the so-called National Conveyor. At the same time, unbilled water accounts for between 32% and 71% of the water fed into the grid. In view of the high energy consumption of the Jordanian water sector and the associated high greenhouse gas emissions, it is all the more important that drinking water is not infiltrated but is available for the supply of the population.The project entails a performance-based contract with a private operator. In order to reduce administrative and technical losses, old pipelines will be rehabilitated, water meters installed, and house connections replaced. The private operator will be responsible for invoicing and bill collection, as well as having the mandate to disconnect illegal connections with the support of WAJ and Yarmouk Water Company. After the construction measures have been carried out, the private operator will take over several years of operation management of the drinking water infrastructure.The aim of the module is to improve the water balance and financial situation of the water company by reducing technical and administrative water losses in the project area, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to strengthen the climate resilience of the population.The project is being implemented in Jordan in the northern governorate of Mafraq in the service area of Mafraq ROU.

The drinking water supply and irrigation in northern and central Jordan are mainly provided by groundwater resources, which are heavily oversupplied. The pressure on the water sector is increasing due to the continued influx of Syrian refugees, especially in the northern governorates of Mafraq, Irbid and Zarqa and in the capital Amman. Due to the high influx of refugees, the total amount of drinking water required has increased significantly. In order to meet the demand, the existing water resources are pumped over and public and private wells are continuously deepened or new wells are built. The consequence of this is that the groundwater level is falling rapidly and the water quality continues to deteriorate. In addition, the sharp increase in groundwater pollution is another problem for water suppliers and is mainly due to overloaded or missing sewer networks and sewage treatment plants and the uncontrolled growth of residential and production areas. So far, pollution-sensitive groundwater areas have not been mapped across the board and measures to protect the resource have not been sufficiently implemented. In order to be able to successfully deal with the enormous challenges in the water sector, it is necessary to precisely assess the existing water resources in the vicinity of the well fields and to allocate the available water resources according to demand while at the same time protecting them in the long term. The aim of the project is therefore: The management and protection of groundwater resources have been improved for the drinking water supply of Syrian refugees and host communities in northern and central Jordan.', 'Der jordanische Wassersektor ist gekennzeichnet durch einen akuten Wassermangel, bedingt durch geringe Niederschläge, starkes Bevölkerungswachstum und ineffiziente Bewirtschaftung der Wasserressourcen. Die Trinkwasserversorgung und die Bewässerung in Nord- und Zentraljordanien erfolgen im Wesentlichen durch Grundwasserressourcen, welche stark überfördert werden. Der Druck auf den Wassersektor erhöht sich aufgrund des anhaltenden Zustroms von syrischen Flüchtlingen vor allem in die nördlichen Governorate Mafraq, Irbid und Zarqa sowie in die Hauptstadt Amman. Durch den hohen Zustrom an Flüchtlingen ist die Gesamtmenge an benötigtem Trinkwasser erheblich angestiegen. Um den Bedarf zu decken, werden die vorhandenen Wasserressourcen überpumpt und öffentliche und private Brunnen kontinuierlich vertieft oder neue Brunnen angelegt. Die Folge davon ist, dass die Grundwasserspiegel rapide fallen und die Wasserqualität immer weiter abnimmt. Zudem ist die starke Zunahme von Grundwasserverschmutzung ein weiteres Problem für die Wasserversorger und hauptsächlich auf überlastete oder fehlende Kanalisationsnetze und Kläranlagen und das unkontrollierte Wachstum von Wohn- und Produktionsgebieten zurückzuführen. Verschmutzungsempfindliche Grundwassergebiete sind bislang nicht flächendeckend kartiert und Maß nahmen zum Schutz der Ressource nur unzureichend umgesetzt. Um die enormen Herausforderungen im Wassersektor erfolgreich bewältigen zu können, ist es erforderlich, die vorhandenen Wasserressourcen im Umfeld der Brunnenfelder genau abzuschätzen und die verfügbaren Wasserressourcen entsprechend dem Bedarf zu zuteilen und gleichzeitig langfristig zu schützen.

Gleichzeitig entstehen durch das Vorhaben öffentliche Treffpunkte, was den sozialen Zusammenhalt verbessert."", 'Context\n\nAccording to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 660,000 refugees from Syria were officially registered in Jordan by March 2023. That corresponds to a 10 per cent increase in the Jordanian population. 81 per cent of the refugees live in host communities, thus placing heavy demands on basic infrastructure. There is a lack of functional public green recreational areas as well as insufficient funds to maintain them.\n\nObjective\n\nRefugees are employed to create green infrastructure in Jordan thus improving their income situation, providing green space for community use and contributing to climate change adaptation.\n\nApproach\n\nThe project is part of the Special Initiative ‘Displaced Persons and Host Countries’. The measures benefit refugees and host communities. Female and male cash workers build or rehabilitate green infrastructure using local materials and based on simple designs at affordable costs. They create picnic areas in forests or hiking trails in nature reserves to build recreational areas for communities and at the same time preserve nature and ecosystem services. Native drought-resilient trees are planted for reforestation. The project pays particular attention to the needs of women and girls in the public sphere and promotes employment opportunities for them.\n\n4,600 workers have been employed for at least two months in 14 communities and 23 rural areas. Half of the workers are vulnerable Jordanians, while the other half are Syrian refugees – almost 30 per cent are women. Through the earnings, the financial situation of participants improves. After the end of the employment relationship, all workers have the opportunity to participate in trainings.\n\nIn addition, the project creates green infrastructure and thereby contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and is a tool to adapt to climate change. It also provides public space for communities to meet and enhances social cohesion.']","['Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ)', 'Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)']","['Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ)', 'Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)', 'Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH', 'Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH', 'Ministry of Environment']",447fec3ee2bfd61acf8a83271aad5b93,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Jordan', 'Amman']",['development'],"['Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ)', 'Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)']","['Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH', 'Ministry of Environment']",2025-06-04T09:51:27.878725

In addition, capacities of water sector institutions to measure consumption will be enhanced to make water management efficient and resource protective. These are fundamental for the social and economic development and the water access of the population.\nTo this end, the flow measurement services offered by the Jordan National Metrology Institute will be enhanced. The cooperation between the QI institutions and the institutions of the water sector (ministry, authority, as well as water supply utilities) will be expanded in order to increase the capacities of the water sector in the field of water flow measurement. For this purpose, the project mainly relies on workshops and trainings. In addition, technical equipment is being procured for relevant fields of application.\nThe target group of the project is the population of Jordan, including Syrian refugees.\nThe project works primarily in Jordan's capital Amman, where most of the actors are located, while water companies outside Amman (Yarmouk, Aqaba) are also involved in the project processes."", 'Jordanien zählt zu den Ländern mit der höchsten Wasserknappheit.

Angesichts der extremen Wasserknappheit tragen diese Verluste dazu bei, dass die Wasserversorgung der in den letzten Jahren stark gewachsenen Bevölkerung (10,5 Mio. sowie 770.000 registrierte syrische Geflüchtete) nicht nachhaltig gesichert ist und in großen Teilen des Landes nur intermittierend erfolgen kann.\nDas Vorhaben soll dazu beitragen, neue Dienstleistungen bei den Institutionen der Qualitätsinfrastruktur zu etablieren und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen QI und dem Wassersektor zu verbessern. Daneben werden Kapazitäten des Wassersektors zur Verbrauchsmessung erweitert, um das Wassermanagement effizient und ressourcenschützen zu gestalten.\nZu diesem Zweck soll das Angebot der Dienstleistungen im Bereich der Durchflussmessung des Jordan National Metrology Institute (JNMI) verbessert werden. Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den QI-Institutionen und denen des Wassersektors (Ministerium, Behörde, Wasserversorgungsunternehmen) wird ausgebaut, um die Kapazitäten des Wassersektors bzgl.

Die Partizipation von Frauen wird durch die Etablierung sogenannter Water Wise Women-Gruppen erhöht. Aufgrund des Erfolgs der partizipativen Herangehensweise ist vorgesehen, ein partizipatives Ressourcenmanagement-Konzept beim zuständigen Wasserversorger zu verankern.', 'Context\nJordan is one of the most arid countries in the world. In some locations, up to 70 per cent of water is being lost as a result. The ensuing shortages were already a challenge for municipalities when the system only had to supply Jordanian households. As of July 2022 Jordan, Syria’s southern neighbour, had officially registered more than 677,000 displaced people from Syria. More than 80 per cent of them are living outside of official refugee camps. Host communities have to provide the necessary infrastructure for refugees, which pushes many communities to their limits.\n\nObjective\nThe availability of clean water in 14 of the host communities and in Jerash Camp has improved.\n\nApproach\nThe project is being implemented in 14 host communities to ensure that around 78,000 residents – among them more than 12,700 refugees – have adequate access to water. Interventions include repairing dilapidated water networks, as well as improving water use efficiency and water storage capacities. Moreover, barrier-free entrances to water facilities are installed in private households and public institutions.\nThe Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) contributed to the project implementation in Bait Ras and Jerash Camp, improving water management at the household level for more than 15,000 residents.\nResidents of the 14 host communities can voice their concerns at regular dialogue meetings where local community members and Syrian refugees speak to the responsible water providers to discuss water-related issues and the future construction measures needed. Thus, representatives of all societal groups play a pivotal role in ensuring that water is distributed equitably across communities and in alleviating conflicts. Women participation is increased through establishing Water Wise Women (WWW) groups. Based on the success of the participatory approach, the plan is to anchor a participatory resource management concept at the responsible water provider.']","['Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ)', 'Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)']","['Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ)', 'Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)', 'Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH', 'Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH', 'Ministry of Water and Irrigation-MWI', 'Direktion für Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit (DEZA/engl.

The GCFF combines grants from donor countries with loans from multilateral development banks to create concessional financing packages for refugee-affected countries, initially Jordan and Lebanon. Supporting donor countries (nine donor countries) provide funds to the GCFF, with the World Bank acting as Trustee. As a supporting donor, Canada is a member of the Steering Committee for this financing mechanism. GCFF’s overall goal is to provide critical medium and long-term development support to refugee populations as well as impacted host communities in Jordan and Lebanon. The GCFF establishes a sustainable, long-term and predictable financing platform for countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by addressing the problems of gaps in multi-year and medium-term financing typically associated with development and emergency humanitarian interventions. Through access to low-interest loans, the GCFF enables critical investments urgently needed to support infrastructure projects and programs in areas such as education, health, and job creation to create sustainable development outcomes. This is expected to help countries better absorb the economic and social shocks of the refugee crisis and assure the well-being of vulnerable populations within their borders.

Households who had minimal income prior to COVID-19 measures, have lost their usual source of livelihood and are struggling to cover basic needs in the short-term will be targeted through this project. A total of 835 households (4,175 individuals) from refugees and host communities will be provided cash assistance, of which 200 individuals including women, men, girls and boys identified with psychosocial needs will be directly supported by ICMC’s counselors, ensuring holistic support. Through providing PSS, ICMC aims to build resilience and support the development of positive coping strategies that will result in more protective family environments and complement the overall impact of its cash assistance intervention. Both the cash assistance and counselling will be provided to households living in urban and rural areas of Irbid, Mafraq, Zarqa, Jerash, and Ajloun governorates. The planned intervention will build on ICMC’s demonstrated experience in delivering timely and impactful cash assistance to alleviate urgent financial needs, and provision of high-quality PSS to individuals with specific protection needs. The project has been designed to reflect the priorities laid out in the Basic Needs COVID-19 Emergency Response Plan and developed based-on consultation with other partners in the sector to ensure wide coverage and non-duplication of beneficiaries. Further, the project activities are informed by the findings of ICMC’s rapid needs assessment conducted in April, which identified how needs and risks among vulnerable groups have evolved since the health pandemic. As with all of ICMC’s cash-based assistance projects, close coordination with UNHCR and the Ministry of Social Development will allow ICMC to obtain lists of potential refugee and Jordanian host community beneficiaries for the project. All potential beneficiaries will be assessed using ICMC’s comprehensive vulnerability assessment tool which closely reflects UNHCR’s Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF). This tool will ensure that households who recently lost their primary source of income, who have limited financial resources, high levels of debt and other economic vulnerabilities due to COVID-19 are prioritized for assistance. Additionally, the tool includes the short set of Washington Group questions to identify people with disabilities, as well as tailored questions designed to capture the protection needs of highly vulnerable groups due to their specific profiles including women and older individuals (age 60+) at risk, survivors of SGBV, people with disabilities, children at risk, and single parents/caregivers. Provision of the cash assistance will follow the Basic Needs COVID-19 Task Force’s standard assistance packages based on family size, targeting priority groups with specific needs related to gender, age, and disability, and PSS cases will be identified following the vulnerability assessment, based on recommendations from the caseworkers. ICMC is in the final stages of transitioning to the Common Cash Facility (CCF) platform for all of its cash distributions and expects this process to be completed by the start of the project. In case the CCF transition is not yet finalized upon inception phase of the project, ICMC will conduct the project’s distributions through local money lenders (Alawneh) in branches that are centrally located and accessible to the project’s beneficiaries. ICMC has also adapted its SOPs for cash distributions to reflect COVID-19 prevention measures in country.

At the beginning of May, the government of Jordan (GOJ) started to relax the lockdown measures. By now, people are starting to go back to work, but several sectors are still only partially open, and some even remain completely closed. The government is observing the epidemiological situation and adjusting regulations on a weekly basis.\n\nVulnerable members of refugee and host communities who are living below the poverty line and have lost their jobs bear the highest economic cost. With most of these persons have been out of work for over two months, and many still facing limited prospects for an income in the coming weeks, these vulnerable refugees and Jordanians have been unable to meet their basic needs or gone into greater debt in order to make ends meet. Sadly, others have resorted to negative coping mechanisms, including, according to UN Women, a 25% increase in reports gender based violence globally. A UNHCR-led taskforce (for refugees) and the Government of Jordan (for Jordanians) created beneficiary lists containing the cases hardest hit by the economic shock.\n\nBecause of its experience in cash assistance, generous private donors, and a large network of local partners in Jordan, World Relief Germany (WRG) was able to respond quickly to the crisis. WRG was the first NGO to provide Covid-19 cash assistance in April. Other NGOs, UNHCR, and the GOJ have followed suit and started providing Covid-19 related cash assistance in recent weeks. Despite these efforts, still half of the refugees eligible for Covid-19 cash assistance, and many vulnerable, eligible Jordanian families, have yet to receive cash assistance.\n\nThis project will help close the gap by supporting 1,424 households (8,620 individuals) with a one-off, unconditional cash transfer in order to help them meet their immediate basic needs, and avoid resorting to negative coping mechanisms, including domestic abuse. This project will cover beneficiaries in Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, and Mafraq governorates where a large number of urban refugees and vulnerable Jordanians are residing. 70% of the funds will be used to support refugees and 30% to support host communities all in accordance with the regulations set by the Government of Jordan.

The present proposal suggests an assistance through a 2-month cash support, followed by a safety net package in line with the recommendations of the COVID-19 Response Task Force (CRTF) of the Basic Needs Working Group (BNWG). The eligibility criteria for the selection of beneficiaries are in line with the sector response and include 1) high debt per capita, 2) a high Consolidated Approach to Reporting Indicators of Food Security (CARI) score, and 3) high prevalence of other specific protection risks, such as female-headed households, people with disabilities (PWD), elderly people, and households with a high dependency ratio. \n\nCACH and its local implementing partner Caritas Jordan (CAJO) have previously implemented various emergency cash assistance, multi-purpose cash, cash for work, and cash for protection in Jordan for vulnerable refugees and Jordanians of a total value of around USD 10 million. Currently, Caritas is implementing the OCHA-funded project (JOR-19/DDA-3560/SA2/Sh./INGO/14856) “Warm for Winter III” (W4W3), which initially was planned as a shelter winterization response. In agreement with OCHA, Caritas repurposed W4W3 in favor of a COVID-19 response in March 2020 to provide cash assistance to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians. C4C will act as a continuation and scaling of W4W3 and mitigates the impact of the Government of Jordan (GoJ) imposed lockdowns, restriction movements and absolute curfews that has been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. The two actions will benefit from economies of scale resulting in higher cost-efficiency of the present proposal.\n\nTechnically, the cash assistance will be delivered through the Common Cash Facility, a platform used by UN agencies, NGOs and the Jordanian Government (municipalities) to deliver cash assistance to the most vulnerable refugee and Jordanian HHs through the iris scan and/or mobile wallets. Caritas is a CCF member and will deliver the assistance through the mobile wallet platform “Mahfazti”. The selection of beneficiaries will be highly automized through a customized data analysis provided by Caritas’ own database along the eligibility criteria of CRTF. The beneficiary lists will be cross-checked with UNHCR RAIS to ensure no duplication of the same HH is receiving cash assistance. Caritas will directly contact eligible beneficiaries to inform them of their entitlement, duration, and to assist them in opening a mobile wallet account. Caritas will prepare an instructional video on opening mobile wallet and how to use it which will be shared with all beneficiaries with smartphones. To those who lack a smartphone or have difficulties in operating one, Caritas will provide direct assistance in meeting them at Umniah shops. Post-distribution monitoring will be conducted after the 1st instalment to verify the effectiveness of the new cash delivery mechanism and check for the beneficiaries’ feedback on and satisfaction with using Mahfazti. In addition, baseline and endline surveys will be conducted to check if HHs were able to meet their basic needs, reduced negative coping strategies and confirm overall satisfaction with the assistance.']",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",96fdfe56965870ab9544d98f37d8fd2e,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Amman', 'Irbid', 'Mafraq', 'Madaba', 'Zarqa', 'Jordan']",['humanitarian'],"['Jordan Humanitarian Fund', 'Caritas Switzerland']","['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan']",2025-06-04T09:56:17.009618

As of 2 June 2020, the total number of the COVID 19 confirmed cases around the world are 6,394,452, and the number of death, 377,971. For Jordan, it is reported 746 as the total confirmed cases and 9 as death. It is considered that the government of Jordan has relatively well managed to respond to the virus comparing to other neighboring countries. However, it is also seen that the current lockdown caused by COVID 19 has brought an inevitable, negative impact on the economy in Jordan. Especially female-headed Syrian refugees, who already suffer from vulnerable livelihood conditions by their refugee status, have faced a more acute challenge due to almost zero possibility for stable income under the period of lockdown and partial curfew. The crisis and confinement measures have resulted in an increased risk of violence in the household, food insecurity and economic insecurity. With this inference JHCO designed this project targeting 60% women and girls for immediate and urgent measures that will include the provision of cash assistance directly to vulnerable women to meet basic needs and to reduce tensions at the household level, which are both linked to increased risks of violence.\n\n\n The government has been making a lot of effort to support the vulnerable, but external supports from the international community are still required to comprehensively respond to the COVID 19 situation with Syrian refugees and Vulnerable Jordanians because the government is also losing most of the sources for revenue. Furthermore, imposed restrictions on economic activities due to COVID 19 are expected to extend to the third quarter and till the end of the year, anxiety caused by uncertainty has brought the vulnerable psychological stress.\n\nJordan Hashemite Charity Organization -JHCO Cash Assistance Project aims to support the most vulnerable Syrian refugees and Jordanians who have lost their means of livelihood to meet their basic need given a priority to people with disabilities, elderly, and women households.\n\nJHCO will assist (1425) Cases to cover their basic need with a one-time cash transfer through CCF two modalities (IRIS Authenticated cash assistance delivery) to the Syrian refugees and (Mobile wallets - Mahfazti ) for the Jordanian.

There are 5,900,527 COVID-19 cases across the world: 2,577,181 recovered and 361,764 have died (Worldometer, Coronavirus, May 27, 2020). COVID-19 is an unprecedented global emergency, both in terms of the scale of public health preparedness and response, as well as its broader social and economic impacts due to associated lockdowns, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.\n\nThe urgent COVID-19 health response in Jordan negatively affects the capacity of the health system to respond to the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated health needs of the population. NCDs are the leading cause of mortality in Jordan, accounting to almost 80% of all deaths (World Health Organization, Jordan Health Profile). Equally, the economic consequences of COVID-19 and NCDs are massive due to the combined healthcare costs and lost economic productivity from the lockdown due to COVID-19, NCDs, and premature deaths caused by COVID-19 and NCDs. Current and projected repercussions from COVID-19 and an uncontrolled NCD burden on vulnerable host communities, specifically refugee populations, requires an urgent, enhanced, enlarged, integrated health system response, and development of a robust NCDs programme in Jordan. \n\nThe Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) will prioritize the Health sector in this project proposal, based on its previous experience with Healthy Community Clinic (HCC) program since 2011 providing NCDs prevention and care and recent COVID-19 national campaign, as well as local consultations with the Ministry of Health (MOH), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Health Organization (WHO), its partners, international and national non-governmental organizations (INGOs/NGOs), The project will support saving lives, alleviate suffering, and increase access to humanitarian assistance for vulnerable People with Special Needs, such as People Living With NCDs (PLWNCDs), NCD patients, elderly people at risk, Syrian refugees, refugees of other nationalities, and vulnerable Jordanians, inclusive of people with disabilities, prioritizing female-head households, incorporating gender mainstreaming, when possible. RHAS will provide safe and effective clinical care for NCD patients through care for individuals who are at the highest risk for poor outcomes, ensure that older patients, patients with comorbid conditions, and other vulnerable people are prioritized. The project’s interventions will be multi-sectoral, with the aim to prevent and control COVID-19 and NCDs to foster a healthy societal environment, in which people are encouraged to make and maintain healthy living choices promote health literacy so that people can protect and improve their health build the capacity of health care providers provide health services focused on early detection of COVID-19, cost-effective management of NCDs and their risk factors respond to the specific needs of vulnerable groups with NCDs affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and keeping communities as protected as possible from the impact of COVID-19 and NCDs. To maximize the project's impact, the project activities will address critical needs in the Health sector and address the needs of healthcare providers, prioritizing areas with the highest needs, complementing sector projects and interventions in targeted geographical areas (primarily north and central governorates of Jordan), to support coherence and added value. The implementation of the project would promote a focus on COVID-19 and NCDs by the public health system in Jordan, specifically at primary care and community levels, whereby COVID-19 and NCDs are prevented and managed for refugee populations and Jordanians through an integrated national response. This would be embedded within the idealized transition towards ‘universal health coverage’ for all, galvanized by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).""]",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['Royal Health Awareness Society', 'Royal Health Awareness Society', 'Arabian Medical Relief Jordan', 'Caritas Jordan', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",613aadb08a20ae65442c21a53d398196,"['Syria', 'Other', 'mixed_or_unspecified_refugees']","['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural', 'camp']","['Al Mafraq', 'Amman', 'Irbid', 'Zarqa', 'Jordan']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],"['Royal Health Awareness Society', 'Arabian Medical Relief Jordan', 'Caritas Jordan']",2025-06-04T09:56:17.647373

Due to several internal issues encountered by DFAT, DFAT’s funding strategy for the next three years was delayed severely impacting upon IMCs’ ability to effectively plan its future funding strategy. In February 2020, IMC received a top-up from DFAT to cover the period 1st March 2020 to 31st December 2020 (until release of the DFAT funding strategy). However, the top up was significantly less than needed amount to meet the required operational costs for 2020, and was further impacted by a significant exchange loss (as was IMCs’ ECHO funding). \n\nCoupled with a reduction in funding from ECHO (due to ECHO’s internal re-prioritization of funding towards Syria), IMC has experienced a significant reduction in funding from two of its major funders for this vital facility. Despite implementation of a major cutting of costs within the facility, and strong and continued advocacy efforts with DFAT, IMC has not received any information regarding DFAT’s future funding priorities, and therefore is currently requiring urgent financial support to ensure the uninterrupted provision of care.   \n\nIn order to mitigate against a gap in funding that might negatively impact on IMCs’ ability to implement essential and lifesaving reproductive health care services, IMC kindly requests the urgent support of JHF/ UN-OCHA to ensure the uninterrupted provision of high-quality sexual and reproductive health services.\n\nUnder the proposed intervention, IMC will continue to build upon comprehensive Sexual and Reproductive health (SRH) services established since 2014.

Building on ICMC’s extensive experience as a key provider of cash-based assistance and specifically winterization cash assistance, the project will address time-sensitive needs for refugees and host communities in Irbid, Mafraq, Zarqa, Jerash and Ajloun. Households living in urban and rural areas will be prioritized, ensuring the project’s wide geographic coverage. Winterization cash assistance will complement other protection services already provided by ICMC, ensuring a comprehensive and holistic assistance approach. ICMC’s project is designed to reflect the priorities of the Winterization Task Force for 2020-2021, the JHF’s second allocation, as well as the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) for COVID-19. By designing a project that will support the wider goals of the sector and overall response in Jordan, ICMC will ensure its assistance is not duplicated with other actors, and that the assistance provided has the farthest reach. ICMC has a vast outreach network and proven experience assessing the needs of vulnerable beneficiaries. The project will outreach a total of 800 vulnerable households and 775 will be assisted. Identification of beneficiaries will take place not only through ICMC’s comprehensive outreach and vulnerability assessment process, but also through referrals from community-based organizations, receipt of lists from UNHCR of cases that have already undergone the VAF, and lists from the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD) of vulnerable Jordanians. Through each of these channels, and use of its own vulnerability assessment tool, ICMC will uphold its commitment to assisting the most at-risk families and individuals who otherwise would not meet their urgent needs during the winter period. ICMC’s assessment tool is closely aligned with UNHCR’s VAF and includes protection related indicators to identify risks associated with gender, age, ability, and family composition to determine overall need and vulnerability. The tool also includes the short set of Washington Group questions to ensure persons with disabilities are identified through an established and recognized method. The tool is regularly updated to include recommendations from the working groups and task forces in which ICMC participates.  ICMC’s assessment tool will ensure highly vulnerable families with protection needs due to their specific profiles are prioritized including women and older individuals (age 60+) at risk, people with disabilities, girls and boys at risk, and single parents/caregivers. Examples of risks faced by these specific groups may include but are not limited to being a survivor of GBV, high levels of household debt, threat of eviction, living in sub-standard conditions, individuals that have serious medical conditions or chronic illnesses, and those at risk of further protection issues. In accordance with the Winterization Task Force’s Standards this year, assistance will be provided based on family size, using the established values for families who do not receive other cash-assistance. Unconditional cash assistance will afford families dignity and choice in meeting their winter needs and will be distributed in a manner that is both accessible and safe. Specifically, cash will either be distributed through a contracted money lender (Alawneh) in centrally located and accessible branches or through the Common Cash Facility (CCF). Through this project, ICMC aims to complement existing efforts to meet the basic needs of the most vulnerable families, recognizing that a high need remains for targeted, winterization support this year.

According to UNHCR Jordan Factsheet of Sep 2020, the majority of Syrian refugees in Jordan live in urban areas and in poverty: Approximately 80 percent of Syrian refugees live under the poverty line and only two percent of households have savings. 46.7% of refugees are children, 4.8% are elderly, 4% have disability, 3.8% are children at risk and 2% are women at risk. Crisis and Covid-19 have tremendous negative effects on the living conditions of both Syrian refugees and Jordanian host communities. The influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan has placed substantial pressure to infrastructure, and the availability and quality of public services has deteriorated in the northern governorates. Furthermore, the refugee influx has caused price increases in host communities: increased demand for food and basic commodities and for rental accommodation has led to both becoming more expensive. \nAccording to UNHCR Jordan Factsheet of Sep 2020, the majority of Syrian refugees within Jordan live in four governorates: Amman (271,598), Irbid (137,251), Mafraq (86,949) and Zarqa (51,377). According to a survey carried out by UNHCR in 2017, refugee households employ a wide variety of coping mechanisms to help make ends meet. Most survey respondents, for example, reported eating less expensive food (75%), reducing accommodation costs (73%), reducing food intake (72%), and borrowing (60%). Very few, however, admitted to using the types of coping strategies that they perceive will be frowned upon. For instance, only 1% said they have sent their children to work in the past month, only 3% said they had married their daughters to reduce expenditure, and only 5% said they had pulled children out of school. Their research found that cash assistance is helping families avoid dangerous coping strategies. IRJ recent needs assessment was carried out with 3471 families in Amman, Irbid, Ramtha, Mafraq, Jerash and Balqa. 43% of participants families are headed by a female, and 57% by a male. The following percentages represent the winterization needs of the respondents: 21% blanket, 21% gas cylinder, 21% gas heater, 11% carpet, 11% clothes and 15% other.\nBoth Syrians living in urban areas and Jordanian host communities are having difficulties providing their basic needs, and the JRP 2020-2020 has made it clear that their strategy is to provide targeted social assistance for the poor and marginalized to allow them to maintain a basic level of consumption and dignity. Furthermore, according to GHRP, Covid-19 has spread unevenly across the world in the face of continued community transmission, coupled with socio-economic fallout, Covid-19 will aggravate existing vulnerabilities and create or exasperate humanitarian needs far into 2021. Therefore, one of the strategic priorities of GHRP is to preserve the ability of people most vulnerable to the pandemic to meet their food consumption and other basic needs through humanitarian assistance among other approaches.This project is designed as a response and in line with the findings of the recent needs assessment of IRJ and UNHCR, and in line with JRP 2020-2022 and GHRP.

The response is built upon the provision of legal services and cash distribution. \nThe first portion is focused upon the increasing the legal protection and PSEA awareness of Syrian and Jordanian boys and girls, including those with disabilities, and parents and caregivers, with a specific focus on single mothers and caregivers. This is completed through the provision of legal protection and PSEA awareness sessions which mainstream gender, GBV, and child protection to 600 parents and caregivers in the targeted area. There will be 30 sessions in total given by ARDD lawyers, 10 in each area, with each session having 20 beneficiaries. The sessions will follow relevant health and safety guidelines and procedures. Furthermore, the beneficiaries under this intervention will be accessed mainly through outreach and mobilization activities conducted through CSO and CBO members of the Jordan National NGO Forum (JONAF) operating in the targeted areas and outreach will also be conducted online. The inclusion of JONAF members is vital to the outreach activities as it allows for access to hard to reach communities and allows ARDD to leverage the trust the CBOs and CSOs have leveraged within the targeted areas. \nThe second portion is focused on the provision of legal support for at risk Syrian and Jordanian boys and girls, including those with disabilities, and parents and caregivers, with a specific focus on single mothers and caregivers. The types of cases to be addressed could vary in nature, from cases associated with SEA, GBV, registrations, child labor, among others. ARDD will firstly provide its lawyers a refresher training on PSEA, GBV, and Child Protection. ARDD lawyers already have significant experience in each of these areas, especially in child protection as ARDD has recently completed a program for OCHA concerned with child protection. ARDD lawyers will provide consultation and mediation services for 1500 beneficiaries with 500 beneficiaries in each area. ARDD will provide litigation services for a total of 90 beneficiaries with 30 litigations in each areas. According to past experience in child protection, it may be expected that 70% percent of the consultations, mediation, and litigation services provided to minors will be for boys, and 30% to girls due to boys being more likely to be in conflict with the law.

Particularly as the number of cases in Jordan grows, the ability to quarantine at home in case of confirmed or potential infection is crucial, as well as the ability to isolate, particularly among populations more susceptible to COVID-19, including older persons or those with underlying health issues. Having secure shelter, which is already a challenge among refugees and vulnerable Jordanians, becomes even more important during a pandemic.\n\nIn response, this project aims to secure tenure of shelter and support prevention of COVID-19 among refugee and vulnerable host community women, girls, boys, and men (WGBM) with special needs in Jordan through provision of four-month conditional cash-for-rent assistance.\n\nUpon conducting assessments, IOCC has identified the need for rent assistance among 300 refugee (70%) and vulnerable Jordanian (30%) households in Amman (150 households), Irbid (75 households), and Mafraq (75 households) that include persons with disabilities (PWDs), older persons at risk, and women at risk, as well as those with chronic health issues, who are most threatened by COVID-19 and its impacts in Jordan. The inability of these populations to secure shelter can have compounding negative impacts on their health and future, result in forced movement and potential increased exposure to COVID-19 (i.e. due to eviction), and prevent them from isolating or quarantining as needed and in line with requirements of local authorities.\n\nBuilding on its assessments, calls to its hotline, referrals received, and coordination with local actors, such as Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), IOCC Field Coordinator and Project Officer will oversee the finalization of beneficiary selection. Project staff will follow up with landlords regarding needed documentation (such as valid lease contracts and other supporting documentation) coordinate the signing of a tripartite agreement between IOCC, the landlord, and the beneficiary and finalize the list for rental payments. In line with the Shelter Working Group Cash-for-Rent Guidelines, rent will be paid directly through landlords. IOCC will provide payments through transfers via a local money exchange company (Alawneh Exchange) with which IOCC has experience providing conditional and unconditional cash transfers during COVID-19. IOCC will cover rent for a four-month period (via two transfers of two months each). \n\nProvision of cash-for-rent assistance will secure tenancy among vulnerable populations and ensure that eviction is avoided among those most vulnerable and susceptible to COVID-19. Additionally, this assistance will ensure that vulnerable households do not resort to negative coping strategies to make rental payments and also free up beneficiaries' financial resources typically put toward for other needs, such as paying debts, purchasing hygiene items to support COVID-19 prevention efforts, needed medical care, and other important costs. Particularly as livelihoods have been negatively impacted by COVID-19 and prevention efforts in Jordan, this assistance is crucial.\n\nThroughout project implementation, IOCC will ensure regular monitoring of activities and communication with beneficiaries and landlords through IOCC's Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, Learning (MEAL) Officer with oversight and support from the Country Representative. At the conclusion of the project, this will include conducting post-distribution monitoring (PDM) surveys to ensure satisfaction, gather information on the impact of assistance, and ensure that no issues arose during implementation.\n\nIOCC has successfully implemented cash-for-rent activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and has utilized lessons learned and best practices from projects implemented in previous months to inform the design of this proposal.""]",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['International Orthodox Christian Charities', 'International Orthodox Christian Charities', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",fbd0448d3af5d7102d39db0a121070fa,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Jordan', 'Amman', 'Irbid', 'Al Mafraq', 'Mafraq']",['humanitarian'],['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],"['International Orthodox Christian Charities', 'IOCC', 'Ministry of Social Development (MoSD)']",2025-06-04T09:56:28.300999

Syrian refugees in Jordan in particular often live in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, with already depleted financial resources for basic purchases. Given that COVID-19 can be easily transmitted in crowded places and that the virus can live on surfaces for hours, days, or potentially weeks in some cases, it is important that vulnerable populations have the proper access to resources to protect themselves from virus transmission risks. Refugees living in Azraq Camp, the Emirati Jordanian Refugee Camp, and nearby Informal Tented Settlements (ITSs) have been underserved in recent months, with minimal or no hygiene or cleaning kit distributions. Given the precarious economic situation of these populations, especially after governmental restrictions on movements and economic activities, they are less likely to prioritize hygiene and cleaning items over other basic necessities. Additionally, refugees in Azraq Camp and some ITSs use communal water distribution points, requiring multiple trips to carry water back to their shelters. Often these water collection jugs are small, broken, and/or dirty, requiring extra trips and potentially contaminating the water. As women are often more responsible for water collection and care giving duties, this can cause an extra burden and exposure risks for women to the water collection point and in using the communal latrines themselves and to help children or elderly family members. This project therefore aims to support vulnerable Syrian refugee men, women, boys, and girls living in Azraq Refugee Camp, the Emirati Jordanian Refugee Camp, and ITSs in Zarqa Governorate with critical water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) support in response to COVID-19 in Jordan. An estimated total of 8,492 men, 8,778 women, 12,970 boys, and 12,260 girls will benefit from the project across all targeted locations. Action Against Hunger will utilize its well established experience leading in WaSH support in Azraq Camp while expanding to nearby areas (ITSs and the Emirati Jordanian Refugee Camp) also in need of receiving these critical items. Specifically, this project will aim to improve access to hygiene and cleaning supplies, water containers, and hygiene promotion messaging to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission for Syrian refugees living in the aforementioned areas, while considering the different needs and roles of men, women, boys, and girls. This will be completed through the distribution of standardized hygiene and latrine cleaning kits, clean and secure water containers, and contextualized hygiene promotion and awareness raising messaging. Hygiene promotion messaging will utilize a variety of modalities, including WhatsApp messaging, phone calls, SMS, and the distribution if Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials to ensure individuals have access to key hygiene behaviors to complement the distribution of hygiene and cleaning items. Action Against Hunger will ensure that the implementation of all activities promotes the ""do no harm"" principle and considers the different needs, wants, and abilities of the beneficiaries to promote equal access for men, women, boys, and girls. Feedback will be solicited, analyzed, and considered throughout all stages of implementation through various channels, such as Action Against Hunger\'s established Feedback and Complaints Mechanism (FCM) hotline and through all community mobilization interactions to promote accountability to the affected populations, and different communication channels will be utilized to increase accessibility for men and women. Post distribution monitoring will also allow beneficiaries to provide feedback on the implementation of activities and ensure Action Against Hunger can measure the impact of the project against the project indicators.']",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['Action Contre la faim', 'Action Contre la faim', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",4174e179c1116f82b4b73a34c160090f,['Syria'],['refugees'],['camp'],"['Zarqa', 'Azraq Camp', 'Emirati Jordanian Refugee Camp']",['humanitarian'],['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],['Action Contre la faim'],2025-06-04T09:56:28.096453

In September 2018, IMC, through complementary funds, commenced Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) activities in Irbid Specialty Hospital (ISH) to address the needs of female refugees residing in the northern governorates. Between 1st September 2018 and 30th April 2021, IMC recorded 9,972 admissions and 8,197 deliveries. Similarly, since 2014, IMC has also played a fundamental role in the provision of health care support in Azraq camp running the only hospital within a camp of 42,681 residents (49.5% female, 50.5% male). In November 2015, with the support of UNHCR and UNFPA, IMC commenced operations as lead agency of Azraq camp hospital. Since commencement of operations within the facility, IMC has ensured implementation of activities via multiple sources of funding, including UNICEF, UNHCR, JHF, DFAT and ECHO.\n\nThe necessity for SRH services is further emphasized by the number of girls and young women reached who were under the age of 18. From 1st January 2020 to 30th April 2021, IMC in Irbid supported 275 deliveries, 49 gynecological procedures, 2,217 ANC, 779 PNC, and 215 family planning consultations. In Azraq, IMC supported 32 deliveries and 137 ANC and 36 PNC consultations. During the same period, for those under the age of 18, IMC conducted 19 abortions to save the life of each girl (1 in Azraq and 18 in Irbid) and, for those aged 18, IMC conducted 221 abortions (150 Azraq and 71 in Irbid) to save the life of each woman.\n\nHowever, as a result of funding reductions from key donors such as BPRM, ECHO and DFAT (due to internal prioritization of funding towards Syria and the COVID-19 pandemic), IMC has experienced a significant reduction in funding for both Irbid and Azraq hospital facilities and is, therefore, currently requiring urgent financial support to ensure uninterrupted provision of care.\n\nUnder the proposed intervention, IMC will continue to build upon comprehensive Sexual and Reproductive health (SRH) services established in Azraq and Irbid. The SRH services will include: antenatal care (ANC)/postnatal care (PNC), health education (on topics such as early and exclusive breastfeeding, danger signs during pregnancy and in newborns, importance of immunization, among others), family planning, safe delivery services, medical and surgical management of obstetric and gynecological issues, and the clinical management of rape, as well as comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (CEmONC). \n\nThese services will utilize the pre-existing hospital structures inside both Irbid hospital and Azraq camp, and will operate in synergy and coordination with other services and departments inside both facilities. Management of obstetric and newborn emergencies will be undertaken within these hospitals. Women and girls requiring advanced care, as well as high-risk cases, will be referred for further management to other facilities. IMC will provide the services in line with 3RP Health Sector requirements and Sphere’s Core Humanitarian Standards. \n\nIMC will continue to adopt an SRH social protection lens to female reproductive health, ensuring the unique health and protection needs of female refugees and vulnerable host community members are met (adhering to the Sphere Protection Principles).

Having been providing rental assistance to vulnerable households in Jordan since the onset of the refugee crisis in Jordan in 2012, ICMC has consistently applied learnt lessons to improve its programming. As a continuation of this, and following its Cash-for-Rent Assistance Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs, in annex), ICMC will identify extremely vulnerable families who are struggling to meet rental payments or are threatened with eviction. 436 vulnerable households will receive conditional cash-for-rent assistance through cheques provided to landlords in two installments, including a mid-term verification process, for up to the equivalent of 4 months of rent assistance. All beneficiaries will also be provided with information on their contractual obligations and legal rights as tenants. ICMC will conduct community outreach, taking advantage of its continuously updated outreach database –now including information on nearly 7,500 households outreached since September 2015-, and its close relationships with community-based organizations (CBOs). This in order to identify and assess the vulnerability and potential eligibility of refugee and host community households, based on its well-established vulnerability assessment system and project-specific criteria. ICMC will crosscheck all potential beneficiaries with partner agencies, while also refer urgent cases to appropriate service providers, in line with detailed standard operating procedures.

Specifically, ICMC will identify extremely vulnerable families who are living outside of camps in urban areas that are unable to meet their basic household needs, including managing the upcoming harsh winter weather conditions. 650 vulnerable households will receive unconditional cash assistance. ICMC assistance will fully comply with the winterization standards, as defined by the Interagency Winterization Taskforce for 2016-2017 in Jordan, as well as the UNHCR cash assistance SOPs. Monetized assistance will be based on an inkind package equivalent, as per the costs estimated by the Winterization Task force, and on a two-tier system (tier 1: Households not previously served with winter assistance and tier 2: Families who received winterization assistance the previous year but are still in need). ICMC's use of unconditional cash assistance is based on beneficiary feedback collected during its 2015-2016 winter intervention and to enable beneficiaries to spend the money on what they perceive as their most urgent needs this winter. Through community outreach, ICMC will interview and assess 750 households, use its continuously updated outreach database, and draw on its established relationships with community based organizations (CBOs) operating in Mafraq and Irbid, as well as by coordinating with the Ministry of Social Development, in order to identify potential beneficiaries based on established eligibility criteria. Within the framework of the Regional Refugee amp Resilience Plan 2016-2017 (3RP), and specifically the Jordan Response Plan (JRP), this project seeks to complement ongoing efforts to meet the basic needs of vulnerable families. Through its community outreach modality for identifying beneficiaries, ICMC is able to accommodate and meet the varying needs of women, girls, men, and boys, and other groups with special needs. By visiting individuals in their homes, ICMC is able to reach households with limited mobility or with special concerns who may have been otherwise unable to approach an organization to request assistance. Community outreach and home visits are conducted by teams of one man and one woman, allowing both men and women to feel comfortable with their interviewer. All potential beneficiaries for winterization must undergo a special assessment and must meet ICMC’s vulnerability criteria, which are modeled after the Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF), which prioritize particular vulnerable beneficiaries including but not limited to the elderly, persons with disabilities, serious medical conditions or chronic illnesses, male or females headed households with high debt levels. The VAF is gender sensitive and includes protection mainstreaming measures particularly targeting vulnerable women such as female headed households, single females with no social/family support or income, or pregnant or lactating women with no social/family support or income, or families with children not attending school or being forced to work.650 households will be selected to receive cash assistance through the use of a contracted money lender, so the families can buy the items they require. This will allow ICMC to target very vulnerable households while still providing beneficiaries with a greater sense of agency. The families that are found not to meet the specific criteria for this project may be referred to ICMC’s other winterization projects or other services, or to another organization. Through this and other complementary projects ICMC will help to alleviate the immediate critical winterization needs of men, women, boys and girls in Irbid and Mafraq, contributing to the overall Jordan Response Plan.""]",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['International Catholic Migration Commission', 'International Catholic Migration Commission', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",720782e25cec66305e628295893353c1,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",['urban'],"['Al Mafraq', 'Irbid', 'Jordan', 'northern Jordan']",['humanitarian'],['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],['International Catholic Migration Commission'],2025-06-04T09:56:51.072485

In Za’atari, the WASH blocks were very large and were designed to cover the needs of hundreds of people surrounding the blocks. In Azraq Camp, the WASH blocks were designed very differently, with twelve shelters in each plot served by two twin WASH blocks (each consisting of a washing area and a toilet) set on either end of the plot, with male facilities at one end of the plot and women’s facilities at the other. As Azraq Camp evolved, households gradually stopped using the communal WASH blocks, and began bathing in their own shelters. The low usage rates of the current WASH blocks, in which only 8% of girls and women use the facilities 9% of boys and 11% of men, have highlighted protection, physical and safety concerns shared by the Syrian refugees.This was increasingly evident in the large number of greywater channels across the camps and pools of water outside shelters. These pools posed large risks in terms of public health, particularly to children. The issue of pools of standing water has been a particular concern in Azraq Camp during the previous successive outbreaks of Hepatitis A. To address the concerns of Syrian refugees in using the communal WASH blocks, World Vision aims to expand the greywater project established by UNICEF, in partnership with ACF, in 2016 and implement a household greywater project in Village 5 in Azraq Camp. \n\nWorld Vision proposes to connect all of the households in Village 5 in Azraq Camp to the underground collection tanks at the communal WASH blocks, to enable the greywater from the shelters (from the kitchens and bathing areas) to be collected and safely disposed. WV will consult with other implementing partners on the current design of the greywater system in Azraq Camp, to learn from the lessons and experience of the other partners. To ensure harmonization in approach, reduced operation and maintenance complexities, as well as improved monitoring and coordination, WV will implement this Greywater Project, in accordance with the agreed design and implementation methodology for the greywater network project in Azraq Camp, and in coordination with UNICEF, ACF and other partners. Due to the size of Village 5, WV will acquire additional funds required for the effective implementation of the Greywater Project and cover any additional costs further incurred due to slow rate of implementation, challenges, additional labour costs etc. WV will proactively participate in the various sector coordination at a camp level and national level to work closely with other partners, which may also be awarded JHF funding for the installation of greywater systems in Azraq Camp. To ensure sustainability of this project, WV will provide Operations and Maintenance (OampM) training and tools to targeted beneficiaries living in each block (total of 241 blocks) in Village 5 of Azraq Camp. during the duration of the project and before its completion and handing it over the project to UNICEF.\n\nThe proposed project aligns directly with WASH sector priority - Cash assistance in Villages 2 and 5 targeting vulnerable individuals through the expansion of the Greywater Project, JRP sector specific objective - Providing safe and equitable access to gender appropriate sanitation services in Zaatari, Azraq and KAP camps, and included in the JRP 2018-2020 project 6.2 (REF 6.2 - Construction, operation and maintenance of (greywater network) in camps).

This project is part of WRG's community based family strengthening program. The following proposal draws from lessons learned during our last two winterization projects in 2016/2017 (supported by OCHA) and 2017/2018.\n\nAs in all our programs, WRG will work closely with our thirty local partners. They will refer the most vulnerable people in their community to WRG, and we will crosscheck them with the VAF scores on RAIS or if this is not available by doing our own vulnerability assessment (shortened VAF assessment). We will work with partners from the Amman, Zarqa, Mafraq, and Irbid governates. This grass-roots approach will allow us to identify vulnerable people that would not be served otherwise: Either because they have no VAF scores or are not registered on RAIS, or because their situation has dramatically changed for worse since the last VAF assessment. And this approach allows for a good prioritization among the vulnerables as the combined amounts of all involved agencies will not be able to support the winterization need of all the vulnerable - prioritization therefore has to be done one way or the other. WRG will instruct partners on vulnerabilities that typically deserve prioritization, such as female headed households or households under eviction threat. \nWRG will disburse one-time winterization cash assistance to vulnerable households outside of camps, via the Common Cash Facility (CCF) for Syrians and wire transfer for Jordanians. The amounts provided are based on the Winterization Task Force standards. This task force (WRG being part of it) decided on amounts that should cover winter-related expenses depending on the household size. WRG aims to provide 862 vulnerable households with cash for winter assistance, benefiting directly some 4,310 individuals. \nWRG will keep a protection focus through all phases of the project cycle. The project itself is mitigating protection concerns: As seen in our previous evaluation (PDM), providing cash for basic needs already reduces household tensions among at risk households and therefore helps preventing negative coping mechanisms. More than that, WRG trains up our partners, visiting teams and staff to be able to deliver basic psycho-social support during a visit, invite them to (WRG) programs run by our local partners that meet some of the typical protection needs of refugees (education, SGBV, domestic violence, early marriage) and refer people to organisations that offer specialized support in different fields.""]",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['World Relief Germany', 'World Relief Germany', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",23b66c3b5682dc5636d5d8fe4d1f53d4,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Al Mafraq', 'Amman', 'Irbid', 'Zarqa', 'Mafraq', 'Irbid', 'Amman', 'Zarqa']",['humanitarian'],['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],['World Relief Germany'],2025-06-04T09:57:02.073137

Description of Beneficiaries). In each governorate, Caritas has established centres with previous experience in shelter maintenance. The caseload is distributed across these centres to ensure needs-based and timely implementation.\n\nThe selection of HHs starts by analysing vulnerability assessment framework (VAF) data captured through Caritas centres’ outreach work in the 5 targeted governorates in the past 3 months (around 3,500 HHs assessed) to identify HHs that fit the selection criteria. Referrals from the Working Groups or the Ministry of Social Development can be included. A gender-balanced team of 1 caseworker and 1 field monitor per centre/governorate (10 staff members total, based at the respective centres) will conduct home visits to confirm eligibility and winter shelter upgrade needs. Technical staff (1 engineer, 2 technical assistants) confirms the HHs’ selection and signs off on the works to be carried out.\n\nBased on previous experience, Caritas will conduct one bidding processes per governorate to identify one suitable contractor per governorate (5 in total). In each bidding process, contractors will be invited to submit offers based on tender documents and bills of quantities and are selected based on a minimum of 3 offers from 3 different contractors.\n\nFor each shelter, technical staff agrees in writing with tenants, owners and contractors on the prospective maintenance works. A full-time legal advisor will support negotiations with property owners to secure tenure for all shelters for at least 1 year and reducing the monthly rent by 10% in line with the shelter sector guidelines, if applicable. During the upgrades, caseworkers and monitors will conduct spot checks and avail themselves for questions, complaints and other feedback. They also distribute booklets with information on tenants’ rights and obligations and give an appropriate introduction to the targeted HHs. Technical staff conducts a technical acceptance check in the presence of all stakeholders, following which invoices can be submitted by the contractor. Lastly, a survey to understand satisfaction rates, protection concerns, and unintended negative effects will be conducted. All afore-mentioned activities are documented and checked (cf. Monitoring and Reporting Plan).\n\nCaritas will enable families to cope by upgrading basic shelter infrastructure through the following activities:\n\n1-\tRepairing windows and doors that do not close properly\n2-\tReplacing doors and windows that cannot be repaired or installing new ones in those households that lack doors or windows\n3-\tTreating leakages from ceilings or walls through plastering or use of special sealants inside the homes or on the roof of households\n4-\tInstalling water boilers to enable families to have hot water during winter ensuring connection to hot water by replacing or installing needed pipes or minimal electrical installation works for the boilers\n5-\tPainting walls with excessive mould providing families with targeted information on how to prevent mould formation\n6-\tSecuring connections of heaters to electricity\n7-\tOther maintenance works that will be determined during home visits.']",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",3e7dd20c62e6b51c41b00f459bcdb8cc,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Al Mafraq', 'Amman', 'Irbid', 'Madaba', 'Zarqa']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['Caritas Switzerland', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']","['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan']",2025-06-04T09:57:07.615854

As most families keep girls at home, child labor primarily affects boys. Findings from the 3RP (Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan) show that child labor is the most prevalent form of violence facing Syrian refugee children, whose consequences are severe and last a lifetime: with injuries, school drop-out, and social isolation common. \nGiven the protracted nature of the crisis, the local community capacity must be strengthened to combat child labor. Indeed, Tdh’s Needs Assessment of Child Labor – conducted in late 2016 - in Irbid, Amman, Azraq, and Jordan Valley highlights that holistic interventions are effective and required, and that child labor has to be addressed at the individual, community and national levels through a combination of direct services, capacity building, and awareness-raising.

Core of the action will be the four (4) months of distribution of conditional cash for rent assistance, paid directly to the landlords, and awareness sessions on HLP rights for both tenants and landlords the last month will cover simultaneously the last tranche of payment and final Post Activity Monitoring (PAM).\n\nA total of 410 vulnerable HHs (with an average of 5 family members) in the three (3) governorates of Irbid, Karak and Ma’an will be assisted. Given the high influx of Syrian refugees in the North, 80% of the households this project will support – approx. 328 households – will be from Irbid 10% from Karak and 10% from Ma’an – around 82 families respectively. According to the national standards, 70% of the total beneficiaries will be selected among refugees and the other 30% among vulnerable Jordanian households – totally 287 Syrian families and 123 Jordanian households will be assisted. It is anticipated that a slight majority of women will be directly supported with the proposed project as from our internal database single women are more exposed to challenges related to payment of rent. Identification of beneficiaries will be guided by the criteria established within the VAF, with additional protection-focused tools INTERSOS has developed and already tested. The assistance provided will be in line with the final Guidelines on Cash for rent, and on Increased Awareness about HLP Rights approved by the Shelter Working Group (2016), led by UNHCR, of which this organization is an active member. Lesson learned from the recently ended action have also been integrated in the current proposal.\n\nINTERSOS has recently completed a Cash for Rent program in the same areas of the proposed project. The experience gained allowed INTERSOS to tailor the present project proposal in order to maximize its impact on the target population. This project will allow INTERSOS to continue supporting the most vulnerable HHs among those already targeted with the present action, and to include HHs previously identified but not supported due to funds availability.\n\nINTERSOS has also a deep knowledge of needs and gaps in the target areas, where several projects in other sectors are implemented. Synergies with these projects will be established in order to guarantee both financial effectiveness and a comprehensive assistance to beneficiaries, who will be internally referred to increase their access to assistance.\n\nDisabilities, minorities, age and gender are mainstreamed in all programs and activities and will be constantly taken into consideration throughout this proposed intervention. Mitigation measures, including internal tools, for potential protection concerns are already in place, while the organization will guarantee full accountability of the whole action and of the staff involved.""]",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['INTERSOS', 'INTERSOS', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",eac8de83652d533991f500b34d598d3d,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Irbid', 'Karak', ""Ma'an""]","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],['INTERSOS'],2025-06-04T09:57:17.869779

With the proposed project, INTERSOS intends to respond to some of the above most critical needs refugees living in ITS are suffering from when accessing WASH services. It is important to stress that the present action will complement INTERSOS ongoing program, funded by UNICEF, and will allow INTERSOS to fill concerning gaps in the already implemented and/or scheduled WASH assistance. Specifically, the present intervention will improve access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities for extremely vulnerable individuals and families living in those ITSs INTERSOS and UNICEF are not able to serve, or where the planned response is not sufficient to address all the needs. The planned action will also allow INTERSOS to timely respond to sudden increase in the population size of given ITSs, a common phenomenon in mobile settings. \n\nThe action is to be implemented over a period of six (6) months: in the first month, INTERSOS will finalize the list of ITSs to be prioritized with distributions and installation of mobile latrines water tanks and handwashing stands, and procure the needed material procurement will be in line with INTERSOS regulations. SPHERE standards will be respected, while capitalization of the experience gained in the WASH intervention in ITSs with UNICEF will be ensured in the ongoing program, standard WASH mobile infrastructure for ITSs have been already designed and tested and will be used in the present action. In the first month INTERSOS will also prepare an initial WASH baseline in the ITSs. From the second to the fifth month (4 months), set up of WASH infrastructures, provision of water filters and latrines cleaning kits, establishment of gender balanced WASH committees, and hygiene awareness sessions will be implemented. The proposal provides the needed flexibility to address additional needs emerging during the implementation, if needed. Hygiene Promotion will use the “Hygiene promotion in ITSs Manual”, developed by INTERSOS and endorsed by UNICEF in 2016. WASH baseline and Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be finalized during the last month. The hygiene promotion awareness sessions will be complemented with a distribution of hygiene and dignity kits. \n300 Syrian vulnerable families (approximately 1.500 individuals) in the four (4) governorates of Irbid, Amman, Karak and Ma’an will be assisted with WASH infrastructure. 70% of the families this project will support – approx. 210 families – will be from Irbid governorate 20% from Amman – approx. 60 families - 5% from Karak and 5% from Ma’an – around 15 families respectively. Considering the mobile nature of ITSs, often linked to the agricultural seasons, these are estimation that may change during the implementation. To improve tracking capacity and timely response, INTERSOS will be following the ITSs in their new location, thanks to the “focal point” system already applied in the INTERSOS/UNICEF intervention. 70% of the total beneficiaries will be selected among Syrian refugees and 30% among vulnerable Jordanian households most of the Jordanian beneficiaries, 130 HHs, will benefit from hygiene awareness sessions, and distributions of hygiene and dignity kits.

The seven-year crisis in the country has however caused land degradation and decreased productivity. Findings from the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM, 2016) undertaken by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) in November 2016 estimates that wheat production at country level has been 55 percent lower than the average production achieved prior to the crisis (2007-2011). Furthermore, it indicates that the quality of diet and micronutrient intake in Syria has markedly deteriorated with many households substantially reducing the consumption of meat, dairy products, eggs, vegetables and fruits. The study has also concluded that almost half of Syrian households are resorting to severe, often irreversible coping strategies including selling productive assets. A higher prevalence of severe livelihood coping strategies was observed in the areas that have been directly affected by the conflict, including Idleb, Quneitra, Dara’a, Aleppo, Hasakeh, Sweida, Hama and Rural Damascus governorates.\n\nThe livelihoods assessment conducted by Care International in 2015 indicated that agriculture is a sector which can potentially meet emergency, recovery and livelihood- economic development needs. Comparing with the recent FAO assessment 2016 on counting the cost for the agricultural sector in Syria after 6 years of crisis, 75% of the households’ samples were still growing food for their own consumption. \n\nThis means that promoting livelihoods in Syria through “investing in the recovery of agriculture” will reduce the negative coping strategies and enhancing the economic resilience.  \n\nThe overarching objective of the project is to contribute to the improvement of resilience and food security of vulnerable crisis-affected families in the southern Syria districts.

Children that are unaccompanied, from disadvantaged communities, or are refugees, tend to be more vulnerable to getting in conflict with the law and have inadequate access and awareness on their right to legal services. The poverty pockets of East Amman and Zarqa will be prioritized as there is a shortage of legal services and assistance within these areas, which the Syrian crisis has further exacerbated. In addition, they have limited to no access to litigation, resulting in unlawful detention, imprisonment, institutionalization, and a juvenile record. This project aims to increase protection and access to legal services for at-risk children and children in conflict with the law, including those with disabilities. It will operate by raising awareness through media, street law methodology, legal consultation, mediation, and litigation. \n\nIn addition to ARDD's already freely accessible services, this project will provide additional in-depth legal support to at least 1000 children. Based on our longstanding experience with providing legal aid to people residing in disadvantaged communities it is our experience that roughly 10 % of our consultations end up in court. For children in conflict with the law we will push for diversion orders and alternative measures to a custodial sentence. The latter will be further made possible through ARDD's assessment of what additional support our contracted lawyers require for achieving this goal and through networking and advocacy with relevant governmental and judicial institutions. The street law sessions in disadvantaged communities, a media campaign regarding children's rights and the accessibility and availability of free legal support, also in order to prevent conflict with the law, are crucial as this will enable children and their parents to find appropriate legal support.\n\nARDD will conduct reporting in targeted communities with at-risk children, caretakers, and people in the neighborhood in order to assess the major issues of concern with regard to children’s access to justice. This will include consultations with various stakeholders to analyse existing referral mechanisms with the intention to develop them further based on the needs of the community. The needs assessment provides the foundation for the initiatives including the access to justice sessions and Psychosocial Sessions, which will reach a minimum of 1500 beneficiaries and aim to increase awareness of children's rights, availability of free and safe legal support and strengthen community-based safety nets. \n\nIn order to ensure the coherence of this project with child protection priorities at the national level and establish sustainable efforts towards ensuring children’s access to justice, ARDD will dedicate time to effectively and maintain communication with the Interagency Child Protection Working Group in Jordan to ultimately contribute towards the identification of access to justice for refugee children and unaccompanied and separated children as a long-term priority.

In each location, Caritas has established centres with previous experience in shelter maintenance and protection (namely, referrals and case management). The caseload is distributed across these centres to ensure needs-based and timely implementation. \n\nCurrently, Caritas (CACH and CAJO) is implementing an OCHA-funded project (JOR-18/DDA-3560/SA2/Sh./INGO/10660) on shelter winterization for vulnerable refugees and host communities in the same target areas as this proposed project. The proposed project will act as a continuation with an additional focus on protection mainstreaming, women at-risk, elderly people and PWD. The project will upgrade sub-standard shelters through replacement, repair or maintenance work and prepare the beneficiaries for the coming winter season 2019/2020, with some of the shelter works including moulding repair, roofing insulation and painting better carried out in dry weather conditions. \n\n\nThe selection of HH starts by analysing vulnerability assessment framework (VAF) data captured through Caritas centres’ outreach work in the 4 targeted governorates to identify HH that fit the selection criteria. Referrals from the Working Groups or the Ministry of Social Development can be included if they fit the proposed action’s criteria. A gender-balanced team of 1 caseworker and 1 field monitor per centre/governorate will conduct home visits to confirm eligibility and shelter upgrade needs. Once the beneficiaries are identified, caseworkers will hold awareness raising induction sessions on beneficiaries’ entitlements, Caritas’ and contracted parties’ Code of Conduct, and feedback mechanisms. During shelter assessments, technical staff (1 engineer, 2 technical assistants) confirm the HH selection and signs off on the works to be carried out. \n\nBased on previous experience, Caritas will conduct one bidding processes per governorate to identify one suitable contractor per governorate (4 in total). In each bidding process, contractors will be invited to submit offers based on tender documents and bills of quantities and are selected based on a minimum of 3 offers from 3 different contractors. \n\nFor each shelter, technical staff agrees in writing with tenants, owners and contractors on the prospective maintenance works. A full-time legal advisor will support negotiations with property owners to secure tenure for all shelters for at least 1 year and reducing the monthly rent by 10% in line with the shelter sector guidelines, if applicable. During and after the upgrades, caseworkers and monitors will conduct spot checks and avail themselves for questions, complaints and other feedback. Technical staff will conduct technical acceptance checks in the presence of all stakeholders, following to which invoices can be submitted by the contractor. Lastly, a survey to understand satisfaction rates, protection concerns, and unintended negative effects will be conducted and disaggregated by age, gender and diversity factors (nationality, disability, gender of head of household). \n\nIdentified HH with additional specific needs that fall outside the scope of the proposed action will benefit from internal and external referrals to appropriate services.']",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",f27207e494fe35beb2e01cd7d919366b,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",['urban'],"['Amman', 'Irbid', 'Mafraq', 'Zarqa']",['humanitarian'],"['Jordan Humanitarian Fund', 'Caritas Switzerland']","['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan']",2025-06-04T09:57:35.057779

In order to prioritise cases, NRC uses UNHCR’s Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF) and NRC’s Integrated Assessment (IA). If vulnerability data is not available, NRC conducts a full vulnerability assessment and initially determines the recommended shelter support modality for each household, depending on the specific needs of the household, location and conditions of the shelter. In order to confirm the support modality, NRC conducts a follow-up technical validation visit, looking at technical and physical conditions of the shelter and to confirm landlords’ willingness to participate in the project.\nShelter support modalities offered through this project include: i) flexible (FLEX) shelter package (renovations + rent-free occupancy) and ii) emergency cash for rent (C4R). The NRC C4R response targets households at imminent risk of eviction or under severe protection risks, offering them support in finding alternative housing, and paying rent for a 6-month period in the new property. The new shelter has to comply with NRC Minimum Shelter Standards with regards to, among other considerations, minimum size of the shelter and toilet access.\nConditional cash grants are paid directly from NRC to the landlords and range between 845 and 1,185 USD. \nUnder the flexible shelter package (FLEX), targeted households receive support ranging from 1,270 to 2,260 USD, depending on vulnerability and household size. The financial support provided includes: a) a minimum amount for shelter repairs in exchange for at least 3 months of free rent and b) an amount to cover rent costs for an extra period of time. Overall, the FLEX support provides households with: 1) improved shelter 2) at least 3 months of rent-free occupancy (waived by the landlord) 3) at least 6 month of rent-free occupancy (paid by NRC). Household eligible for FLEX support are encouraged to use NRC’s support in a flexible manner, negotiating with landlords the ratio of renovations and rent-free occupancy to increase benefits received. NRC facilitates negotiations by preparing Bills of Quantities (BoQ) to specify the repairs/upgrades to be done and their cost and holding landlords accountable for the delivery and quality of the renovations. After all parties agree and a lease agreement is signed between the landlord and the tenant, NRC, the tenant and the landlord sign tripartite agreements clarifying roles and responsibilities in the delivery of the shelter support. Upon signature of the agreement, NRC transfers the amount earmarked for repairs to the landlord, who is responsible for executing the works as agreed. Once works are completed, the negotiated rent-free occupancy period begins, with NRC transferring the conditional cash grant to cover the additional months of rent. Based on previous experience, on average households negotiate a 14-month rent-free period from both landlords and NRC.\nThe FLEX approach is regarded by NRC as a major step in efficiency and beneficiary participation, since rent cots for the project have decreased from 210 USD per month to 130 USD per month between 2017 and now. In addition, families have the opportunity to negotiate, move houses and reach better deals on their own terms, which grants more satisfaction and empowerment. Finally, in order to ensure its shelter support is fully inclusive, NRC supports households with Persons with Disability (PWD) by providing them with inclusion kits. The kits are used by NRC for shelter adaptations aimed at facilitating PWD’s movement in and around the house and at enhancing their independence in Activities of Daily Living.']",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['Norwegian Refugee Council', 'Norwegian Refugee Council', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",6304b0ab5febf0ad1bebfe67e7e9dc43,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Al Mafraq', 'Irbid', 'Jordan']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],['Norwegian Refugee Council'],2025-06-04T09:57:34.953339

Safe water storage continues to the be one of the most significant concern for ITS households, due to inadequate quantity of clean water storage containers, leading to further risk of water contamination before consumption.\n\nINTERSOS has identified inadequate or absent WASH infrastructure as a widespread problem in host community housing occupied (usually rented) by vulnerable refugees and Jordanians, with many of these households also depending on informal (trucked) water supplies or municipal water supply that is compromised (in terms of quality by inadequate plumbing, and many of these households also lacking basic sanitation facilities.\n\nAmong households with inadequate WASH infrastructure, people with disabilities (especially children with disabilities) and older adults are disproportionately affected, as even existing facilities are not well-adapted to their needs, particularly in terms of physical accessibility infrastructure such as seating support and hand rails. The project will ensure that WASH infrastructure interventions are tailored to maximize access to these individuals, through a detailed household assessments. Furthermore, protection concerns for women and girls will also be addressed, especially through provision of female/male designated latrines in ITS settings, and installation of solar powered lights on latrines in ITSs to mitigate risks for women and girls (and boys) when accessing WASH services after dark.\n\nINTERSOS will use its Initial Assessment tool, based on the VAF, to shortlist households for further WASH assessment. A detailed WASH assessment will then be conducted in each shortlisted household (see tool in annex 2), and the data used for final household selection.

The project will build on ICMC’s extensive experience in delivering winterization support and utilizing cash-based modalities to alleviate time-sensitive needs. Winterization cash assistance will be provided to both refugee and Jordanian host community families living in Irbid, Mafraq, Zarqa, Jerash, Ajloun, Balqa, and Madaba governorates, ensuring outreach in remote, rural areas and wide geographic coverage through the project. The project has been designed in compliance with the Winterization Task Force standards for 2019-2020 and closely coordinated with other actors in the task force to achieve extensive reach of beneficiaries and their non-duplication. The project is also aligned with the existing national and regional strategies, including the Regional Refugee Resilience Plan (3RP) and the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) whereby winterization support is prioritized by the social protection sector. In addition to the 500 families that ICMC has already identified through its existing BPRM-funded winterization program, ICMC will outreach an additional 450 families in need as well as refer to its existing database to re-assess families for potential winterization assistance. Families living in urban and rural areas with high levels of vulnerability will be referred to ICMC by community based organizations and assisted through the project. ICMC will coordinate closely with UNHCR to obtain lists of potential Syrian refugee beneficiaries as well as the Ministry of Social Development for lists of Jordanian families in need. ICMC’s commitment to assisting the most vulnerable, at-risk families will be reflected in the project through utilizing its comprehensive vulnerability assessment tool, which has been designed after UNHCR’s Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF). The assessment includes the short set of Washington Group questions to ensure people with disabilities are identified. ICMC’s assessment tool will ensure highly vulnerable families with protection needs due to their specific profiles are prioritized including women and older individuals (age 60+) at risk, people with disabilities, children at risk, and single parents/caregivers. Examples of risks faced by these specific groups may include but are not limited to being a survivor of GBV, high levels of household debt, threat of eviction, living in sub-standard conditions, individuals that have serious medical conditions or chronic illnesses, and individuals who are risk of further protection issues. Provision of winterization assistance will follow the Task Force’s standard assistance packages based on family size. The selected 375 families will benefit from unconditional cash assistance, ensuring dignity and choice as they determine what items are most essential for their families to cope with the winter season. Cash will be distributed through a contracted money lender (Alawneh) in branches that are both accessible and centrally located to the project’s beneficiaries. ICMC is currently in the process of transitioning to the Common Cash Facility (CCF) for all its cash distributions. If the process is completed by the start of the proposed project, the CCF will be used for distribution of winter cash assistance this year. Through this project, ICMC aims to complement existing efforts to meet the basic needs of the most vulnerable families, recognizing that a high need remains for targeted, winterization support this year, particularly in the Northern governorates which are most impacted by the winter season.

This project is part of WRG's community based family strengthening program. The following proposal draws from lessons learned during our last three winterization projects in 2016/2017 (supported by OCHA), 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 (supported by OCHA).\nWRG will assist 712 cases with a one-time cash transfer to cover their winterization needs. The average family size expected in this project is 5 people, totaling 3,560 beneficiaries (30% Jordanians, 70% Syrians outside of camps). Beneficiary names will be received from UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Development (MOSD) and our more than twenty local partners.\nOn the winterization task force meeting at the beginning of December 2019 it was reported, that 6,000 Syrian cases have not been yet covered. We will work with partners from the Amman, Zarqa, Mafraq, and Irbid Governorates to identify eligible beneficiaries from among those 6000 families that fit the beneficiary criteria in this call (women and elderly people at risk / people with disabilities / single parent or caregiver / children at risk). The verification on eligibility will be done via RAIS. If unexpectedly no VAF score is available, WRG will conduct its own vulnerability assessment (shortened VAF assessment). This grass-roots approach also helps identifying those who have no VAF scores and those whose situation has dramatically changed for worse since the last VAF assessment. If most of the cases from our partners are already covered and/or not eligible, we will request cases meeting the beneficiary criteria mentioned above from UNHCR.\nJordanian beneficiary names will be provided by MOSD. The UNHCR co-chair of the winterization task force mentioned the quality of the data from MOSD to be sufficient by now to work with their lists and that one can use specific indicators to receive names that fit the target group. The main benefit of working with MOSD is that duplications can be avoided, as MOSD will ensure that each beneficiary only receives one winterization package. To support further work with MOSD data, we will add some questions to the PDM, in order to measure the vulnerability of the people referred by MOSD.\nWRG will disburse the one-time winterization cash assistance via the Common Cash Facility (CCF) for Syrians and via wire transfer for Jordanians. The amounts provided are based on the Winterization Task Force standards. This task force decided on amounts that should cover winter-related expenses depending on the case size.\nWRG will have a protection focus through all phases of the project cycle. The project itself is mitigating protection concerns, as we have observed from previous post-distribution monitoring (PDM) for winterization: Providing cash for basic needs reduces household tensions among at risk households and therefore helps prevent negative coping mechanisms. More than that, WRG will provide further protection trainings to our partners and PDM teams. The trainings will focus on how to conduct a good home visit and include important topics like psycho-social support, supportive communication, active listening, confidentiality, and referrals. A second day of training will cover more in-depth how to handle cases of domestic violence, child abuse, and how to develop a safety plan. These topics are relevant for those grass-root partners who are in close personal contact with beneficiaries. Some of those trained will be able to use the training to assist in the PDM visits.""]",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['World Relief Germany', 'World Relief Germany', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",afe2dd1635e3be72b9b6571ddfd3065c,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Amman', 'Zarqa', 'Mafraq', 'Irbid', 'Jordan']",['humanitarian'],['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],['World Relief Germany'],2025-06-04T09:57:40.604362

According to UNHCR Operations Portal (5 November 2019), there are 654,266 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan. 531,232 Syrian refugees are living out of camps and concentrated in urban and rural areas in the northern governorates of Jordan. Refugees undergo difficult living conditions where most of them are living below the poverty line and they live in the most disadvantaged areas in Jordan. The crisis has overstrained the country’s infrastructure and strained social services such as healthcare and education. Refugees are struggling to access health services that are not permitted for free as before and they cannot afford for treatment and medication. The humanitarian conditions of Syrian refugees are worsening and protection concerns are existing. The conflict is impacting severely on women and girls in Jordan, increasing GBV risks and exposure for refugee and host communities, with increased demands on services. Sexual and Gender-¬¬based violence (SGBV) among Syrian refugees is manifested in many forms including rape, domestic violence, early and forced marriages, sexual exploitation, and abuse. The project will target 70% Syrian Refugees and 30% Jordanians and host community as per the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation requirements for Syria Crisis Response. IRJ will conduct a baseline assessment in Irbid to identify the beneficiaries with gender-based needs analysis and age markers. A participatory approach will be considered to ensure the participation of the beneficiaries in all project stages.  IR Jordan will coordinate with local CBOs, and community leaders to identify the needs, and will consult with sector cluster and the target groups in the project preparation stage and we will update and verify the intervention (if needed) based on the basic needs cluster priorities. The beneficiaries selection process will be based on the vulnerability criteria including women household, widows with children, elderly persons, persons with disability,  family income, family size, gender, household disability, number of elderly/sick/children in each household, orphan families, and health vulnerability in addition to RAIS and VAF Scoring. According to the Jordanian Response Plan for Syria Crisis (JRP 2019), data analysis across all vulnerability indicators highlights Mafraq, Amman, and Irbid, as the governorates most in need. The overall goal of the project is to work towards mitigating against the risks of the freezing winter significantly impacting the vulnerable Syrian refugees and the Jordanian host communities and thus, IRJ will distribute unconditional cash to families living in Irbid to provide a source of heat through distributing heaters, gas cylinders, gas re-fill vouchers, and blankets, for the families who live in uninsulated accommodation. Children will be the main focus of the project since the distribution of winterization items will reduce the potential risks of cold-related diseases that would severely affect Syrian refugees especially children. IRJ will ensure that community leaders, women and youth will be involved in program implementation and their ideas and feedback will be incorporated. This approach will develop a sense of ownership of the project by the target communities to ensure its success and sustainability.

Low temperatures, rainfall, flooding, and snow threaten vulnerable populations who live in sub-standard shelters and are unable to make seasonal repairs and renovations to address damp and moldy walls, broken windows and doors, and large spaces that do not easily heat. While cash assistance is provided by UNHCR and other humanitarian actors in Jordan, a gap exists in interventions that invest in housing infrastructure and support increased security of tenure among vulnerable Syrian refugees and Jordanians. In response, this project aims to ensure improved living conditions, protection, and dignity for vulnerable refugee and Jordanian women, girls, boys, and men (WGBM) through seasonal shelter rehabilitation for those living in sub-standard shelters.\n\nUpon conducting household assessments, IOCC has identified the need for home repairs and renovations to address urgent, seasonal needs among vulnerable households, particularly among households that include persons with disabilities (PWDs) and elderly at risk who have specific vulnerabilities that must be considered. The inability of these populations to secure shelter that meets their specific needs can have compounding negative impacts.\n\nBuilding on assessment visits, IOCC will deploy outreach volunteers and Site Engineers to targeted areas of Amman, Irbid, and Mafraq to validate household vulnerability and conduct a technical assessment of potential beneficiaries’ shelters. IOCC will select 200 households (60 in Mafraq, 60 in Irbid, and 80 in Amman) for shelter rehabilitation through this project. Additionally, through a public tender process, IOCC will select contractors to conduct rehabilitation work.\n\nIOCC Site Engineers will prepare bills of quantities (BoQs) and rehabilitation plans for each household. Additionally, IOCC will sign an agreement with each landlord and beneficiary that outlines responsibilities during and after the project. In this agreement, IOCC will ensure security of tenure and also negotiate rent reduction, depending on the level of investment in the shelter. Seasonal shelter upgrades will fall into four categories:\n-\tLevel 1 – 0 JOD to 499 JOD – security of tenure for one year and no increase in rent\n-\tLevel 2 – 500 JOD to 899 JOD – security of tenure for one year and rent reduction (at least 10%)\n-\tLevel 3 – investments between 900 JOD and 1,199 JOD – security of tenure for 1 to 1.5 years and rent reduction (at least 20%)\n-\tLevel 4 – 1,200 JOD to 2,000 JOD – security of tenure for 1 to 1.5 years and rent reduction (at least 30%).\nIn addition to consulting the Shelter Working Group’s Technical Guidelines: Upgrading of Sub-standard Shelters, IOCC conducted a market analysis of prices for commonly needed items in rehabilitation to ensure the budget is appropriate.\n\nRehabilitation of shelters will focus first on seasonal needs, such as addressing thermal enhancements, including repair and insulation work that addresses issues of dampness and cold flood mitigation measures and reducing energy demand through efficiency measures. Additional work will be conducted on a case-by-case basis with a focus on safety and health concerns, as well as improved access in shelters for PWDs and elderly at risk.\n\nThroughout the rehabilitation process, IOCC will conduct monitoring, particularly of contractors – technically via Site Engineers, with beneficiaries and landlords via the IOCC Field Coordinator and MEAL Officer, and financially (including on-site) via the Finance Assistant. Site Engineers and the Field Coordinator will provide the final approval of rehabilitation work.\n\nToward the end of the project, the MEAL Officer will conduct surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) to gather information on the impact of activities.

The accrued experience as well as an own contribution by CACH will translate into a more focused and cost-efficient approach, which targets a caseload that is 30% higher compared to the previous intervention. \n\nAs in the past, timely approval of the competent national authorities is anticipated that allows for a speedy response in line with the priorities specified by the sector. The project will improve winter-resilient standards by providing repair and insulation work against dampness, mold, flooding, draught/cold and will thereby advance dignified living conditions for particular at-risk groups through the application of easy to implement and cost-effective energy efficiency measures. The project will upgrade sub-standard shelters, which will also prepare the beneficiaries for the coming winter season 2020/2021.\n\nThe 235 HH (70% Syrian and 30% Jordanian) will be selected from the CAJO database and through referrals that are both crosschecked with RAIS. HH benefitting from the assistance will be selected on the basis of the following criteria: 1) living in sub-standard shelters (shelter type score 3), 2) living in poverty (predicted welfare score 3-4), 3) specific protection risks related to gender, age, disability or extreme economic vulnerability. Caritas has established centres with previous experience in shelter maintenance and protection (namely, referrals and case management) in each area. The caseload is distributed across these centres to continue needs-based and timely implementation. \n\nThe selection of HH starts by analysing data captured during assessments that comply with the vulnerability assessment framework (VAF). Referrals from the Working Groups or the Ministry of Social Development can be included if they fit the proposed action’s criteria. A gender-balanced team of 1 caseworker and 1 field monitor per centre/governorate will conduct home visits to confirm eligibility and shelter upgrade needs. Technical staff confirm the selection and the works to be carried out.\n\nOnce the beneficiaries are identified, caseworkers and legal advisor will hold awareness raising sessions on rights and obligations as tenants, the services beneficiaries can expect to receive, Caritas’ and contracted parties’ appropriate conduct, and feedback mechanisms. \n\nCaritas will conduct one bidding processes per governorate to identify one suitable contractor per governorate. Contractors will be invited to submit offers based on tender documents and generic bills of quantities (BoQ) and will be selected based on a minimum of 3 offers. For each shelter, technical staff agrees in writing with tenants, owners and contractors on the prospective works. A legal advisor will support negotiations with property owners to secure tenure for all shelters for at least 1 year and reducing the monthly rent by 10% in line with the shelter sector guidelines, if applicable. During and after the upgrades, caseworkers and monitors will conduct spot checks and avail themselves for questions, complaints and other feedback. Technical staff will conduct technical acceptance checks in the presence of all stakeholders, following to which invoices can be submitted by the contractor. Lastly, a survey to understand satisfaction rates, protection concerns, and unintended negative effects will be conducted, disaggregated by age, gender and diversity factors (nationality, disability, gender of head of household). \n\nIdentified HH with additional specific needs that fall outside the scope of the proposed action will benefit from internal and external referrals to appropriate services.']",['United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'],"['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan', 'Jordan Humanitarian Fund']",f272c9884e0bdf2c27f431d69b432600,['Syria'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Amman', 'Irbid', 'Mafraq', 'Zarqa']",['humanitarian'],['Jordan Humanitarian Fund'],"['Caritas Switzerland', 'Caritas Jordan']",2025-06-04T09:57:40.851552

The post-2011 refugee influx has deepened Jordan's labor abundance, but it did not alter the structural pattern of job creation Currently, job growth is concentrated in low productivity sectors with localized markets and limited attractiveness to efficiency-seeking investment. Going forward, Jordan is seeking to build resilience into its economy by raising productivity, expanding domestic markets through improved access to finance and stronger institutions for managing risk, and opening new external markets. Jordan's previously successful formula for coping with geopolitical challenges has run into new trends of lower grants, remittances, and investment flows. While the new government will have the benefit of a fresh start on building consensus for reforms, it faces heightened uncertainty over the summer, necessitating accelerated international support. Although Jordan's adaptability in hosting refugees is intrinsic to its history, the economic context for the latest influx has posed particular challenges. Recent poverty data are not available, but earlier declines in poverty are likely to have halted or even reversed for Jordanians. Jordan's response to the country's productivity, jobs, and conflict spillover challenges is to seek international support for the fiscal costs of the spillovers, while using that support to catalyze reforms capable of generating productive jobs in a labor-abundant economy. The Government of Jordan (GoJ) is putting together a five-year priority reform program for equitable growth and job creation whose objective is to set the foundations for higher growth. The program responds to the challenges of prioritizing and implementing reforms that Jordan has included in its strategic documents in the past.

Beslutet tas i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel paragraf 3.11.3. och avser andra året av ett treårigt avtal.\n\nNRC är en stor humanitär organisation som arbetar inom de sex kärnkompetensområden tillfälligt boende, försörjningsmöjligheter och matsäkerhet, utbildning, vatten och sanitet, organisering av flyktingläger och juridisk rådgivning. Deras målgrupp omfattar i första hand flyktingar och internflyktingar men också, när relevant, värdsamhällen och återvändande.\n\nNRC är en viktig partner för Sida då organisationen verkar i några av världens svåraste humanitära kriser, och har en stor insatsstyrka som snabbt kan befinna sig på plats i en krissituation. NRC är för tillfället närvarande i 31 länder, och har en personalstyrka som omfattar 6000 personer, lokalanställda såväl som internationella. Organisationen är till största del självimplementerade, och för 2018 uppskattats att endast två procent av den totala budgeten kommer att vidareförmedlas till tredje part.\n\nSida utför årligen en humanitär allokeringsprocess som ligger till grund för vilka organisationer, landprogram och tematiska / kapacitetsstärkande projekt som ska beviljas finansiellt stöd. I enlighet med denna process bedömer Sida det relevant att under 2018 stödja NRCs humanitära program i 21 länder, samt i ett antal tematiska och externa projekt. Sida avser ingå fleråriga stöd där ett mervärde för detta identifierats. Detta då möjliggörandet av långsiktig planering ligger i linje med Sidas ambition att skapa förutsägbarhet för partnerorganisationer. Uppdelningen av stödet sker enligt nedan: \n \nLandprogram:\n2018: Afghanistan, Eritrea, Etiopien, Irak, Iran, Jemen, Jordanien, Kamerun, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Nigeria, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Syriska Arabiska Republiken, Uganda och Ukraina. \n\n2018-2019: Centralafrikanska Republiken och Demokratiska Republiken Kongo.\n\nSida avser bidra med fastslagna summor per land, men dessa kan sedan användas som oöronmärkta inom respektive lands program, vilket ger NRC flexibilitet att möta de mest akuta humanitära behoven i föränderliga kontexter. För 2018 öronmärks stöd till Information Councelling and Legal Assistance (ICLA) programmet i Palestina då Sida anser att NRCs huvudsakliga mervärde i den specifika kontexten återfinns inom ICLA-programmet.\n\n\n2018-2019: Rapid Response Mechanimsm\nSida stöd till NRCs Rapid Reponse Mechanism möjliggör att NRC snabbt kan svara mot plötsligt uppkomna eller förvärrade kriser.\n\n\nTematiska projekt: \n2018: Strenghtening Global Protection Policy, NRC digital transformation och CaspCap.\n\n2018-2019: Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre\n\nSida föreslår att finansiellt bidra till NRC skyddsarbete genom deras projekt Strenghtening Global Protection Policy som bl a åsyftar stärka det globala humanitära systemet och humanitär policy, och till det NRC/NORCAP-ledda arbetet med stärkandet av kontantbaserat stöd och marknadsanpassade lösningar inom humanitärt bistånd (CaspCap). Sida föreslår också stöd till NRCs interna projekt som riktas mot att förbättra deras digitala lösningar med syfte att leverera bättre bistånd, och till det NRC-ledda arbetet av Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) som verkar för ökad kunskap om internflyktingar. \n\n\nExterna projekt: \n\n2018: NGO plattform Palestina, NGO plattform Jordanien, NGO plattform Libanon.\nSida avser bidra med stöd till tre NGO-plattformar i Palestina, Libanon och Jordanien genom NRC. För Palestina är dessa medel delegerade från Palestinas finansieringskod, beslutsnr 2018-000465, men inordnas under det aktuella avtalet med NRC då detta bedöms kunna bidra till effektivitetsvinster i myndighetens hantering.\n\nSida bedömer NRCs program som relevanta i förhållande till strategin för humanitärt bistånd genom Sida 2017 – 2020 samt de humanitära behov som identifierats i och med Sidas humanitära allokeringsprocess för 2018. NRC var under 2017 Sidas största humanitära NGO-partner, och väntas med detta beslut bli det även 2018.\n\nSida och NRC har samarbetat sedan 2005 och NRC beviljades 2013 strategisk humanitär partnerskapsstatus hos Sida. Sidas innevarande stöd till NRC omfattar ett treårigt samarbetsavtal för humanitär verksamhet (2017-2019), med årliga arbetsplaner och tillhörande budget. \nSida bedömer att samtliga medel för NRCs program 2018 ska utbetalas omgående för att möjliggöra planering och uppstart av verksamheten 1 januari 2018. Detta för att på bästa sätt möjliggöra planering och genomförande av den humanitära insatsen utan fördröjning. Ett avsteg från Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms motiverat. \n\nSidas stöd i aktuell insats är programbaserat, d v s att NRC har rätt att inom ett landprogram fritt fördela medel inom de projekt i landet som bedöms lämpligast. Härigenom ges NRC en hög grad av flexibilitet avseende landprogrammens utformning. Vad gäller stödet till s.k. RRM-insatser samt tematiska och externa projekt ges NRC i dessa rätt att omallokera medel upp till 10 % av projektbudgeten. Detta bedöms motiverat för att NRC effektivt ska kunna möta uppkommande humanitära behov. För större ändringar, eller omallokering mellan länder, krävs Sidas godkännande.\n\nBedömningspromemorian har skrivits på engelska med anledning av att engelskspråkig personal i fält är delaktig i beredning och uppföljning av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirektörens beslut om Sidas språkvalsmatris med tillämpningsanvisningar från den 1 mars 2013.', 'In accordance with Sida’s humanitarian allocation process 2018, Sida proposes to support NRC’s humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries; Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. Sida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection.  The support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida’s ambition to increase our partner’s predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.Sida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC’s Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises.   Furthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project “Strengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action”, to NRC\'s internal work on ""Digital Transformation"" and to NRC’s work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.Sida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms; the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).  In regard to AIDA, the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement, and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding, with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy, decision number XXX XXXXNRC’s target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced persons but also when relevant, host communities and returnees. NRC is working within its six core competencies (sectors); shelter, livelihoods and food security, education, water and sanitation, camp management and legal advice.Sida’s support to NRC comprises a three year agreement for humanitarian activities, for which funding is decided each year based on Sida’s allocation process and NRC’s yearly application. Additional funding is granted through supplementary decisions throughout the year.UPDATE 2021Increasingly NRC is developing its programming on the basis of a gender analysis. It is mainstreaming gender across its 6 core competencies of the humanitarian response. The reporting is still to be improved for capturing performances and outcomes regarding the gender perspective in NRC\'s programmes. NRC is not yet equipped to track the age dimension of the gender perspective in its monitoring framework, but will address this gap as recommended by Sida. This partnership agreement was extended to 31 December 2020 for the activity period. In 2020, NRC received 402.7 mkr in total for its humanitarian programmes and projects, including 330.9 mkr for crisis response in 26 settings, 50 mkr for RRMs and 21.8 mkr for capacity development. Bringing the total of this partnership to 1,306,200,000 kr for the 2017-2020 cycle.', 'In June 2017 NRC’s Board of Directors approved NRC’s new Global Strategy 2018-2020, which outlines NRC’s main ambition and strategic direction of further strengthening the work to provide assistance, protection and durable solutions to people affected by displacement worldwide.  Based on its strategic directions, NRC will strive to achieve four main ambitions: - Be the leading displacement organisations in hard-to-reach areas; - Be a champion for durable solutions; - Become a leader in using data and technology to deliver better; - Be a great organisation to work for.  NRC’s mission statement commits NRC to “provide assistance to meet immediate humanitarian needs, prevent further displacement and contribute to durable solutions”.  In addition, NRC presents to Sida intended results at an outcome and output level on a sector level in each specific country.

ERFerna utgör en viktig komponent i den humanitära portföljen som å ena sidan skall förse humanitära organisationer med förutsägbarhet (genom kärnstöd och fleråriga avtal) och å andra sidan flexibilitet (genom bla ERFerna) - vilket är av avgörande betydelse i plötsligt uppkomna humanitära kriser. Sverige har varit pådrivande för etablering av humanitära landfonder sedan starten 2005, främst av anledningar relaterade till stärkt samordning samt den humanitära responsens effektivitet. I konkreta termer säkerställer ERFerna denna flexibilitet och operationell responshastighet genom följande: \n\n1) Snabb finansiering närhelst under året. \nDetta möjliggörs genom att humanitära aktörer inte behöver äska medel då man redan har en pooled fond i landet som är redo att snabbt allokeras när krisen uppstår. Förutom själva fonden är även de administrativa och beslutsfattande processerna redan etablerade vilket möjliggör för relativs snabba handläggninsprocesser samt snabba beslut av OCHA i samarbete med Humanitarian Country Team.\n\n2) Finansiering av NGO.\nERFen har som huvudsyfte att finansiera NGOs. Dessa har många gånger möjligheten att snabbt svara på relativt småskaliga humanitära behov i områden som inte tillgodosetts av de större humanitära operationerna. \n\n3) Finansiering av lokala aktörer.\nERFerna har som huvudsyfte att finansiera lokala aktörer som många gånger har tillträde till områden som i vilka internationella aktörer saknar tillträde. \n\n4) Finansiering av viktiga dock underfinansierade projekt.\nERFerna har som huvudsyfte att möjliggöra finansiering av viktiga (life saving) interventioner, men som av någon anledning inte erhållit tillräckligt med resurser.

The most urgent concern for migrants is how to find safe and stable spaces in which to live, rest and sleep, both during their journey and when they arrive at their destination. Tents and camps dominate media images of forced displacement, but forced migrants find shelter in many other ways. They may make use of abandoned buildings, stay on the floors of friends and relatives, find rest in self-built shelters, or sleep under trees in the natural environment. Some may find themselves placed in reception centres and immigration detention facilities against their will. Others may be housed in specially created spaces, such as 'villages' made from shipping containers or IKEA-designed prefabricated shelters. Still others may find accommodation through private rentals, supported by cash transfers from aid agencies or forms of welfare from governmental bodies. These types of emergency shelter form a vital infrastructure that result from human improvisation and contingency as much as design or planning. At present this infrastructure is very poorly understood.   Architectures of Displacement begins with the observation that material forms of shelter offer unique insights into migration and refugees. By developing a new interdisciplinary approach to the physical dimension of the refugee experience, this research will provide unique perspectives upon the processes of human adaptation to new circumstances through displacement. The project will explore the impact of different shelter on the fate of refugees, as well as the political and legal consequences of forced migration and its entanglement with the exigencies of shelter. Given the scale of global displacement and the number of people living in 'non-traditional' spaces in large urban areas, there is a particularly urgent need to understand the variety of forms that shelter takes and the experiences and consequences of living in its various forms.   The project draws together three disciplines with distinct but complementary approaches to the study of material forms: Anthropology, Architecture and Archaeology. It will develop a new approach to recording and understanding the variety of temporary architectural forms and material ephemera that are so central to the experience of forced migration. It will document and categorise, for the first time, the diversity and consequences of emergency shelter. And by focusing on the connections between material environments and human experiences, the data gathered by the project will assist policymakers in making informed choices about how to manage the arrival of refugees.   The cross-disciplinary approach of this project builds on three main bodies of research and practice.   1) Architecture brings a focus on the significance of the built environment for human life. It provides a way to consider how forms of shelter are constructed and used, a method for categorising different forms of shelter, and a technique for examining how spaces function.   2) Archaeology brings an awareness of time, duration, and loss to the study. It enables the project to explore the connections between abandonment and shelter, the material circumstances of the repurposing of existing structures, the ephemeral interventions and adaptations made in the natural environment in order to shelter in it, and the traces left by refugees through sheltering practices.   3) Anthropology offers a technique for studying how people react to displacement.

Tragically, despite their best efforts, protection work is often unequal to the threats that children and caregivers face. The consequences are conveyed through the media with depressing regularity: children become 'collateral damage' and young refugees languish in camps or urban slums with insufficient basic support.\nAs a sub-field of humanitarianism, child protection has focussed on the development of technical competence under the guidance of health, psychology and social work experts. This project acknowledges the immense strides taken to professionalise the field while also recognising that a technocratic approach on its own is too narrow and attends insufficiently to issues of power.  The proposed project pursues a multidisciplinary inquiry into the functioning of the humanitarian system and its impact on child protection efforts. We take this system to be constituted by a range of actors: humanitarian agencies, donors and host government authorities as well as children, caregivers and communities.\nA central theme of the research is neglect because globally, child neglect is the most prevalent cause of child maltreatment. Yet, neglect has only just become a focus of concern for child protection organisations in humanitarian settings, which primarily understands it as a failure of caregiving. We will relocate neglect within the humanitarian system in order to understand the consequences for children and caregivers of the workings of power within that system. From this perspective, neglect may take the form, for example, of a lack of attention to particular groups of children or the voices of young people and their caregivers regarding their protection needs. Donor priorities or local politics are two elements within the system that may contribute to the experience of neglect. We are aware that some caregivers fail to give children the care that they are capable of providing. However, we also recognise that there are structural factors that systematically undermine caregivers' ability to meet their duties of care. Thus, we focus on how the humanitarian system supports or undermines the capacity of caregivers to protect and care for their children.\nThe research entails three case studies in two locations. In Jordan we shall look at the situation of Syrians and Iraqis, two displaced populations with significant commonalities. Both have generally enjoyed support from humanitarian agencies to varying extent at different times. The second Jordanian study will focus on Somalis and Sudanese, distinguishable from the aforementioned groups by culture, 'race', and due to less recognition by the state and support from humanitarians. In Gaza we will explore the experience and views of original inhabitants and those who settled as refugees, attending to differences in the support these two groups receive.\nEmploying participatory research methods, social network analysis, family biographies and key informant interviews, we will explore norms of care, the role of humanitarian agencies in assisting caregivers to meet such expectations, and the consequences for children when norms are not realised. The core multidisciplinary research team will be joined by 36 'peer researchers' from the study communities and 9 early career social workers. Thus, the project will build capacity throughout its implementation.\nThe envisaged outputs and dissemination strategy target policymakers within the global child protection field, locally-based agencies, civil servants and parliamentarians in donor nations, general publics, and the research communities themselves. Our overarching goal is to expand thinking and deepen understanding of neglect and child protection in humanitarian contexts and to advance an approach that strives to uphold core humanitarian principles of universality and independence."", 'Research and development activity contributing to the UK’s strategy to address key development challenges.']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL', 'ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL', 'UNIVERSITY OF BATH']",82e0328be4f90d6ebfe1ddfa1dec47f7,"['Syria', 'Iraq', 'Other', 'Palestine']",['refugees'],"['camp', 'urban', 'rural']","['Jordan', 'Gaza']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL']",['UNIVERSITY OF BATH'],2025-06-04T09:59:15.152056

Increasingly, unemployment has become the most critical issue to be solved in making refugees less dependent on aid and better able to create a future for themselves during protracted refugee situations. Yet, employment initiatives for refugee youth in Lebanon and Jordan are often implemented without a thorough analysis and understanding of how refugees with varying status may be integrated into the labour market, and what the potential pathways to integration may be. Education is also increasingly being recognized as an integral component in any response to a refugee crisis, yet one of the main shortcomings in the education available to refugees is that it is embedded in a humanitarian logic that sees education interventions as short-term.

Estimates suggest that approximately 714,000 displaced Syrian children are out of school, and almost half of them are in Jordan and Lebanon. More than 100,000 children in Jordan are out of school, while 143,000 Syrian refugees attend public schools nationwide. The situation is worse in Lebanon, with more than 230,000 children out of school. The majority of displaced Syrian children in the region face a future without adequate access to quality education and training opportunities, including increased vulnerability to social, economic, and sexual exploitation, increased conflict, and limited prospects for future employability.\n\nThe challenges in Jordan and Lebanon’s education systems are similar: overcrowded classrooms, lack of qualified teachers, insufficient educational resources, traumatized children, high dropout rates, and curriculum mismatch. On a more positive note, integration of displaced communities through education is an area that is receiving growing attention, not only for its potential to empower the displaced communities, but also for the promise it holds for achieving co-existence with host communities.  \n\nThis project proposes to address the education crisis (including both inherent and refugee-related challenges) in Jordan and Lebanon using digital learning innovations. In collaboration with project partners the International Education Association, Birzeit University, and the Jordanian Education Initiative, the project will develop and test digital educational tools and resources to enhance accessibility and quality of learning. This includes introduction and testing of new technologies, resources, and pedagogies. It will also include building the capacities of a pool of educators through a training-of-trainers methodology that combines bottom-up with top-down approaches to ensure sustainability and efficient scalability. This project will be implemented in up to 25 schools in Lebanon and Jordan. The proposed interventions will be flexible so they can be effectively applied in formal and non-formal learning settings. They will be easy to deploy at a very low cost (or no additional cost to the system), and they will be easily scaled and readily integrated within the mainstream educational system.', 'Les répercussions du conflit syrien et de la conséquente crise des réfugiés syriens sur les systèmes scolaires en Jordanie et au Liban sont très lourdes. Selon les estimations, quelque 714 000 enfants syriens déplacés ne fréquentent pas l’école et environ la moitié de ce nombre est en Jordanie et au Liban. Plus de 100 000 enfants en Jordanie ne fréquentent pas l’école, tandis que 143 000 réfugiés syriens fréquentent l’école à l’échelle du pays. La situation est pire au Liban où plus de 230 000 enfants ne fréquentent pas l’école. La majorité des enfants syriens déplacés dans cette région auront un accès inadéquat à des études et de la formation de bonne qualité et ils seront plus à risque d’être exploités socialement, économiquement et sexuellement, de vivre des conflits et d’avoir des perspectives limitées d’emploi.\n\nLes systèmes scolaires de la Jordanie et du Liban sont aux prises avec des difficultés semblables : des classes surchargées, une pénurie d’enseignants qualifiés, des ressources insuffisantes, des enfants traumatisés, des taux élevés de décrochage et des programmes scolaires discordants. La bonne nouvelle est que l’intégration des collectivités déplacées au moyen de l’éducation est un sujet digne de beaucoup d’attention, non seulement pour son potentiel d’autonomisation des personnes déplacées, mais aussi parce que l’éducation promet la coexistence avec la collectivité d’accueil. \n\nLe projet propose de résoudre la crise de l’éducation (y compris les difficultés propres aux réfugiés) en Jordanie et au Liban au moyen d’innovations numériques d’apprentissage. En collaboration la International Education Association, l’Université de Beir Zeit et la Jordanian Education Initiative, le projet permettra d’élaborer et de vérifier des outils et ressources numériques d’enseignement afin d’améliorer l’accessibilité et la qualité de l’apprentissage. Cela comprend la présentation et la vérification de nouvelles technologies, ressources et méthodes pédagogiques. Cela comprendra également le renforcement des capacités d’un bassin d’enseignants au moyen d’une méthodologie de formation des formateurs qui allient des approches ascendantes et descendantes afin d’en assurer la viabilité et l’extensibilité efficace. Ce projet sera mis en oeuvre dans au moins 25 écoles au Liban et en Jordanie. Les interventions proposées pourront être adaptées à des contextes formels et informels. Elles seront faciles et très peu coûteuses à intégrer (aucun coût imposé au système), et elles seront facilement extensibles et immédiatement applicables au système scolaire principal.']","['International Development Research Centre', 'Centre de recherches pour le développement international', 'Centro Internacional de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo']","['International Development Research Centre', 'Centre de recherches pour le développement international', 'Canada.

Detta beslut bygger i stora delar vidare på den bedömning som gjordes 2014, samt de kompletterande uppdateringar som inkluderades under 2015 och 2016. Sida anser att bedömningen från tidigare år kvarstår som fortsatt aktuell. Beredningspromemorian har samtidigt uppdaterats där så har ansetts vara nödvändigt och relevant  (i beredningen märkt: UPPDATERAT 2017). \n\nDenna bedömning ligger till grund för det kompletterande insatsbeslutet som motsvarar en ettårig förlängning (2017) till det nu gällande treåriga avtalet (2014-2016) med ICRC. En ettårig förlängning anses motiverat för att möjliggöra en bredare översyn av dialogmål och dialogfrågor med ICRC inför kommande flerårsavtal (planerad 2018-2020). Medelstillägg om 410 000 000 SEK för insatser under 2017 föreslås genom detta kompletterande insatsbeslut. \n\n--------------------\n\nICRC utgör en av de främsta humanitära aktörerna i länder och kontexter med väpnad konflikt, med ett mandat i den internationella humanitära rätten (IHR). ICRC:s övergripande mål är att skydda liv och värdighet hos människor utsatta för väpnad konflikt eller andra situationer av våld. ICRC:s målgrupper är definierade inom IHR och utgörs av civila, frihetsberövade, sårade och sjuka. För att nå dessa målgrupper arbetar ICRC genom fyra verksamhetsområden i alla program som implementeras av ICRC:s delegationer: skydd, bistånd/materiellt stöd, prevention/förebyggande och samarbete. \n\nICRC presenterade sin humanitära appell för 2017 under december månad 2016. Se länk: https://app.icrc.org/worldmap/2017-appeals-operations/\n\nDetta är en givargemensam appell och budget. Sida begär inte in en egen ansökan eller budget. ICRC inkom i december 2017 med ett förslag till fördelning på landprogram, baserat på humanitära behov och finansiella resurser, som diskuterats med ICRC för att sedan färdigställas av Sida.\n\nICRC:s totala budget för 2017 uppgår till 1818,8 MCHF (c:a 16,2 miljarder SEK), varav 206,7 MCHF (c:a 1,8 miljarder SEK; motsvarande 11,4 % av den totala budgeten) går till huvudkontorets särskilda appell, vilken utgår från huvudkontorets verksamhet. UD stödjer huvudkontorsappellen med runt 50 MSEK/år (Sida stödjer inte den appellen). UD har för avsikt att öka stödet med 5 MSEK inför 2017, vilket ger ett totalt kärnstöd om 55 MSEK 2017. Under hösten 2016 tillsköt UD ytterligare stöd (60 MSEK) genom höständringsbudgeten, vilket innebär ett totalt kärnstöd om 110 MSEK under 2016.  \n\nResterande budget om 1612,1 MCHF (c:a 14,4 miljarder SEK) går till ICRC:s insatsappeller, vilket är en ökning med  86,6 MCHF (c:a 771 MSEK; 5,7 %) jämfört med 2016. Ökningen beror främst på att de humanitära behoven i världens oroshärdar har fortsatt att öka. \n\nICRC:s 10 största insatser sett till budget (vilka utgör 56% av hela bugdeten) är Syrien, Sydsudan, Irak, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, DRK, Ukraina, Israel/Palestina och Jemen. Programmen (skydd, bistånd/materiellt stöd, förebyggande, samarbete) och målgrupperna (civila, frihetsberövade, sårade och sjuka, aktörer med inflytande, nationella rödakors- och rödahalvmåneföreningar) är desamma som förevarande år. ICRC arbetar i mer än 80 länder, har 2 186 anställda som internationell personal och 13 442  lokalanställda. \n\nICRC:s verksamhet är kostnadskrävande och det humanitära biståndsprogrammet utgör den största budgetposten (67,3 % av budgeten) då man arbetar i mycket svårtillgängliga områden och till stor del med matleveranser. Inom appellen inkluderar varje insats en administrationskostnad om cirka 6,5 % för att bidra till huvudkontorets omkostnader för stöd till fältet. \n\n--------------------\n\nSida framtar varje år, utifrån nationella behovsbedömningsprocesser, så kallade Humanitära krisanalyser (HCA). Bedömningarna visar på identifierade humanitära behov och aktörers kapacitet att implementera i respektive humanitär kris, och dessa bedömningar ligger till grund för Sidas årliga humanitära allokeringsprocess. Den humanitära behovsbedömningen sammanfaller ofta med ICRC:s egna bedömning och Sidas bidrag följer i stort ICRC:s totala behov av allokering.\n\nHumanitära kriser är till sin karaktär snabbt skiftande både geografiskt och i intensitet. ICRC har framfört att tidig utbetalning av årliga bidrag för humanitära insatser är en förutsättning för att organisationen ska kunna ingå förpliktelser i form av anställning av personal och kunna påbörja den upphandling av de varor och tjänster som behövs för programmen.\n\nSida bedömer därmed att samtliga medel för insatsen ska utbetalas genom två större utbetalningar för att möjliggöra planering och uppstart av projektet till 1 januari 2017. Detta för att på bästa sätt möjliggöra planering och genomförande av den humanitära insatsen utan fördröjning.

Syrian displacement is also exacerbating and compounding other challenges in the region, including an unprecedented increase of the youth population, daunting economic problems, weak governance systems, and a rise in identity politics and extreme ideologies to which frustrated and discontented publics are vulnerable. IDRC and the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies (LCPS) jointly organized and hosted a meeting on the Syrian refugee crisis in Beirut in April 2016. The aim was to launch a local initiative to enhance the response of host countries to the impact of the crisis on both host countries and refugee communities in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. Three themes were discussed: tapping the economic potential of Syrian refugees; managing the social integration of the refugees, and promoting social cohesion between host and refugee communities; as well as understanding security implications and the impact of radicalization and militant activity on host countries. Discussions centred on promoting the sharing of experiences across countries in best practices and lessons learned as well as advocating collaboration within countries among local, domestic, and international actors. The meeting explored local mechanisms to promote innovative and evidence-based thinking about solutions to the Syrian refugee crisis, such as task forces to enhance knowledge, propose policy options, provide a forum for stakeholder discussions on options and their implementation, and coordination mechanisms to promote interaction, prevent overlap/duplication, and support smooth and coherent responses for crisis management. Care was taken to ensure that any future initiatives support the preparation for a post-conflict environment, including providing Syrians with the skills to contribute to reconstruction efforts. Participants included government officials, academics/experts, research centres, international organizations, Syrian refugee communities, and members of the donor community. Following the results of the meeting, IDRC will strive to work with like-minded donors and international partners to further elaborate and support the launch of this local initiative. The objective of the meeting and the planned initiative are in line with the broader Government of Canada response to the Syrian refugee crisis in the region, which aims to enhance the resilience of host communities and refugees in the region and to find solutions that promote employment and economic growth, provide basic services, and foster good governance.', ""Le déplacement des réfugiés syriens provoque une forte instabilité et une forte insécurité au Moyen-Orient et dans les pays d'accueil dont la capacité d'accueil de réfugiés est utilisée à son maximum. Le déplacement des Syriens exacerbe et amplifie d'autres défis existants dans la région tels que la croissance sans précédent de la population de jeunes, les problèmes économiques extrêmement sérieux, les systèmes de gouvernance faible, et la montée de la politique identitaire et des idéologies extrémistes face auxquelles les populations frustrées et mécontentes sont vulnérables.\n\nLe CDRI et le Lebanese Center for Policy Studies (LCPS) ont organisé et accueilli conjointement une réunion sur la crise des réfugiés syriens à Beyrouth en avril 2016. Il s'agissait de lancer une initiative locale visant à améliorer la réponse des pays d'accueil face aux répercussions de la crise dans les pays d'accueil et dans les communautés de réfugiés au Liban, en Jordanie et en Turquie. Les discussions ont porté sur les trois thèmes suivants : exploiter le potentiel économique que représentent les réfugiés syriens; gérer l'intégration sociale des réfugiés, et promouvoir la cohésion sociale entre les communautés d'accueil et les communautés de réfugiés; et comprendre les conséquences en matière de sécurité et l'incidence de la radicalisation et de l'activité militante dans les pays d'accueil.\n\nLes discussions centrées sur la promotion de la communication d'expériences relatives aux pratiques exemplaires et des enseignements tirés entre pays, ainsi que la défense de la collaboration dans les pays entre les acteurs locaux, nationaux, et internationaux. Les participants à la réunion ont examiné les mécanismes locaux permettant de promouvoir une réflexion innovante et fondée sur des éléments probants au sujet de solutions à la crise des réfugiés syriens telles que des groupes de travail pour améliorer les connaissances, avancer des possibilités de politiques, fournir une tribune aux discussions des parties prenantes sur les options et leur mise en oeuvre, ainsi que les mécanismes de coordination visant la promotion des interactions, la prévention des chevauchements, et le soutien de réponses linéaires et cohérentes à la gestion de crise. On a pris soin de veiller à ce que toute initiative à l'avenir soutienne la préparation d'un environnement d'après-conflit, notamment en fournissant aux Syriens les compétences leur permettant de contribuer aux efforts de reconstruction.\n\nParmi les participants, mentionnons des représentants gouvernementaux, des universitaires et des experts, des centres de recherche, des organisations internationales, des communautés de réfugiés syriens et des bailleurs de fonds. Suite aux résultats de la réunion, le CRDI fera tout son possible pour travailler avec des bailleurs de fonds et des partenaires internationaux ayant une vision semblable afin d'approfondir l'élaboration et le soutien du lancement de cette initiative locale. L'objectif de cette réunion et l'initiative programmée sont conformes à la réponse globale du gouvernement du Canada à la crise des réfugiés syriens dans la région qui consiste à améliorer la résilience des communautés d'accueil et des réfugiés dans la région et de trouver des solutions qui promeuvent l'emploi et la croissance économique, offre des services de base, et encouragent l'essor d'une bonne gouvernance.""]","['International Development Research Centre', 'Centre de recherches pour le développement international', 'Centro Internacional de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo']","['Canada.

Women, men (heterosexual and homosexual) and transgender refugees resort to transactional sex for various reasons, including to meet their basic needs, raise sufficient money to continue their journey, or in exchange for security. In most cases, refugees who engage in transactional sex are at greater risk of physical and sexual violence, mental health problems, unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and HIV/sexually transmitted infections. The silence and stigma around transactional sex — especially among young women — and the poor understanding of the role of gender relations as a driver hinder access to health services and rights to health, privacy, and freedom from violence and discrimination.\n\nThis comparative, multi-disciplinary, and multi-country research study will examine the gendered nature of transactional sex and the sexual and reproductive health and rights trajectories among refugee women, girls, and sexual minority persons, with the aim of developing appropriate interventions to improve policy and programmatic responses. The methodological approach will use ethnographic and qualitative methods in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey and will include preparing and piloting comparative quantitative surveys. The main analysis will describe the impact of transactional sex on sexual and reproductive health with a focus on needs and barriers to these services. This proposed research is part of a larger multi-country research program in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, and Sweden to examine the pattern and experiences of transactional sex and its sexual and reproductive health and rights implications across refugees’ migration journeys originating in the Middle East, and in transit en route to desired safe destinations.\n\nThe study will generate unique evidence to inform public health policies and interventions addressing transactional sex in refugee populations. The research will influence change by fostering a community of practice with local researchers, community members, program managers, policymakers, and other practitioners. A key outcome will be policy recommendations to address the sexual and reproductive health consequences of transactional sex among vulnerable population groups.', 'Il existe une lacune dans les données concernant les tendances et les moteurs des rapports sexuels transactionnels, de l’exploitation sexuelle et des violences dans les rapports sexuels transactionnels et leurs effets sur la santé sexuelle et reproductive et les droits des réfugiés. \n\nBien qu’entourés du plus grand secret, les rapports sexuels transactionnels sont très répandus parmi les populations déplacées de force. Les réfugiés hommes, femmes (hétérosexuels et homosexuels) et transgenres ont recours aux rapports sexuels transactionnels pour diverses raisons, notamment pour satisfaire leurs besoins fondamentaux, gagner assez d’argent pour poursuivre leur voyage ou en échange de la sécurité. Dans la plupart des cas, les réfugiés qui ont des rapports sexuels transactionnels courent un plus grand risque de violence physique et sexuelle, de problèmes de santé mentale, de grossesses non désirées et d’avortements pratiqués dans des conditions dangereuses, ainsi que d’infections transmises sexuellement. Le silence et la stigmatisation entourant les relations sexuelles transactionnelles — en particulier chez les jeunes femmes — et la mauvaise compréhension du rôle des relations entre les sexes en tant que facteur entravent l’accès aux services de santé et aux droits à la santé, à la vie privée et à la protection contre la violence et la discrimination. \n\nCette étude comparative, multidisciplinaire et multinationale examinera la nature sexospécifique des rapports sexuels transactionnels et les trajectoires de la santé et des droits sexuels et reproductifs chez les réfugiées et les minorités sexuelles, dans le but d’élaborer des interventions appropriées pour améliorer les réponses politiques et programmatiques. La méthodologie utilisée au Liban, en Jordanie et en Turquie fera appel à des méthodes ethnographiques et qualitatives et comprendra la préparation et le pilotage d’enquêtes quantitatives comparatives.

Despite these hardships, life in conflict, emergency, and fragile situations continues — people are born, they marry, divorce, and die. Particularly in these contexts, civil registration and identification are vitally important. The hazards faced by people in conflict, emergency, and fragile contexts, including during natural disasters, could weaken or destroy entire civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems and archives, thereby preventing people from receiving the crucial services they rely on, from humanitarian aid to education and job training. Compounding this, CRVS systems are often last on policymakers’ list of priorities, which puts the information and rights of entire generations at risk. \n\nEven in less drastic circumstances, records are at risk of disappearing in the event of a natural disaster, making it difficult to account for deaths and mitigate the consequences of natural disasters. In all these situations, it is critical that governments have robust disaster risk reduction plans in place to protect records. Protecting CRVS systems must be part of each country’s climate change mitigation and adaptation plans to ensure that natural disasters do not leave multiple generations without access to rights and services. \n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, registration and data in real time are becoming more important than ever to correctly track and record the causes of death. \n\nThis project aims to contribute to strengthening civil registration in conflict, emergency, and fragile settings by documenting good practices in this area. This will be done by providing thought leadership, building the capacity of civil registrars and stakeholders in an increasingly fragile world, and contributing to transform the practice in such contexts. To advance knowledge and dialogue, this project will develop a compendium of practices on CRVS in conflict, emergency, and fragile settings; build capacity around the compendium; and disseminate findings in various global forums.', 'Dans le monde, 250 millions de personnes sont en mouvement et un tiers d’entre elles sont piégées dans des situations de conflit en tant que migrants, réfugiés ou chercheurs d’asile. Malgré ces difficultés, la vie dans les conflits, les situations d’urgence et les situations fragiles se poursuit; les gens naissent, se marient, divorcent et meurent. Dans ce contexte, l’enregistrement des faits d’état civil et l’identification des personnes sont d’une importance vitale. Les risques auxquels sont confrontées les personnes dans les situations de conflit, d’urgence et de fragilité, notamment lors de catastrophes naturelles, pourraient affaiblir ou détruire des systèmes d’enregistrement des faits d’état civil et de l’établissement des statistiques de l’état civil (ESEC), empêchant ainsi les personnes de recevoir les services essentiels dont elles dépendent, comme l’aide humanitaire, l’éducation et la formation professionnelle. De plus, les systèmes ESEC sont souvent les derniers sur la liste des priorités des décideurs politiques, ce qui met en danger l’information et les droits de générations entières. \n\nMême dans des circonstances moins dramatiques, les dossiers risquent de disparaître en cas de catastrophe naturelle, ce qui rend difficiles l’estimation des décès et l’atténuation des conséquences des catastrophes naturelles. Dans toutes ces situations, il est essentiel que les gouvernements mettent en place de solides plans de réduction des risques de catastrophe pour protéger les documents. La protection des systèmes ESEC doit faire partie des plans d’atténuation et d’adaptation aux changements climatiques de chaque pays afin de garantir que les catastrophes naturelles ne laissent pas plusieurs générations sans accès aux droits et aux services. \n\nAvec la pandémie de COVID-19, l’enregistrement et les données en temps réel deviennent plus importants que jamais pour suivre et enregistrer correctement les causes de décès. \n\nCe projet vise à contribuer au renforcement de l’enregistrement des faits d’état civil dans les situations de conflit, d’urgence et de fragilité en documentant les bonnes pratiques dans ce domaine. Pour ce faire, il s’agira d’assurer un leadership éclairé, de renforcer les capacités des officiers d’état civil et des parties prenantes dans un monde de plus en plus fragile et de contribuer à transformer la pratique dans ces contextes.']","['International Development Research Centre', 'Centre de recherches pour le développement international', 'Centro Internacional de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo']","['Canada.

In their host nations, these displaced communities seek to reconstruct their lives in a context of loss, poverty, violence and devastation (Kuttab, 2008; Chatty, 2010). Here, as in other contexts of displacement and refugee movements, women and children are subject to the worst effects of such upheaval given their limited power and resources to counteract the ensuing violence and poverty (Al-Dajani and Marlow, 2013; Holmes, 2007; UN, 2006).\n\nAs one strategy to address the matrix of disadvantages and especially poverty arising from displacement, the potential of home based self-employment for women has become a focal point of contemporary policy interest. Such micro enterprising is positioned as a development tool across many contexts as it presents pathways for socio-economic empowerment for women which require few resources but also, do not challenge prevailing cultural patriarchal norms. Our previous research (Al-Dajani et al, 2015) however, suggests that such agencies are perceived to impose numerous stifling constraints upon the displaced refugee women. This tension and the preferences of the displaced women regarding business start-up and trading partners has prompted many women to reject engagement with formal support agencies.

Realigning responses to protracted displacement in an urban world'],"[""For decades, the response by the international community to mass movements of people fleeing war or political persecution has been to provide humanitarian assistance in camps. Yet despite highly-charged debates on the negative impact of maintaining forcibly displaced people in often inhospitable and remote regions and dependent on humanitarian assistance, camps have continued to be a default response to new refugee crises. Camps are not, however, the choice of the majority of the world's displaced people, and estimates suggest that over 60% of refugees and half of internally displaced persons (IDPs) now live in towns and cities. Research, international policy discourse and local action have been slow to catch up.  The experiences of urban refugees and IDPs, their understandings of well-being and self-reliance, and their contributions to host communities remain understudied. There is a critical need for evidence to inform innovative solutions to protracted displacement that support both the specific vulnerabilities of displaced people and the needs of the urban poor amongst whom they often live.  With the ultimate goal of improving self-reliance, well-being and the productive livelihoods of refugees, returnees and IDPs this research examines the potential of an urban response to protracted displacement to assess how cities can foster displaced people's self-reliance and local integration, while benefitting host governments and communities. The research is the first large-scale study to compare experiences of displacement in cities and camps and provide evidenced analysis of the comparative outcomes for displaced people in these different settings. It focuses on four countries with large displaced populations: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Jordan and Kenya,   The ultimate goal is to improve the well-being and productive livelihoods of displaced people and to enable their full participation in urban life and contribution to host cities. The overall aims of the research are to: 1. Build an evidence base for national and local governments, humanitarian agencies and donors on the opportunities and challenges of hosting displaced people in camps vs. urban areas 2. Promote an assessment of current responses to urban protracted displacement, raising awareness of unmet need and the potential economic and social contributions of refugees and IDP for host cities 3. Build the capacity of municipal authorities, displaced people, organisations of the urban poor and other local actors to use participatory planning to develop innovative, inclusive solutions to forced displacement.  The countries studied host some of the largest refugee and IDP populations in the world. All four countries rely on international aid to support the costs of the displaced - particularly those in camps who lack the right to work and whose freedom of movement may be limited. Three of the four countries are piloting the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, the UN's 2016 vision for managing forced displacement.   Through partnership with displaced and host populations, and collaborations between international experts, operational actors, developing-country academics, local NGOs and affected communities, this research project will produce: an assessment of how an urban response can support a rights-based approach to local integration; guidance for municipal governments facing large influxes of people, and evidence to support international policy and decision-making on innovative solutions to protracted displacement."", 'The Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) supports cutting-edge research to address challenges faced by developing countries.

The project will entail research in five of the world's largest refugee camps. Zaatari and Azraq (Jordan), Kilis (Turkey), Mae La (Thailand), Nyarugusu (Tanzania). These have populations of up to 250,000 and hence are in many ways cities. They have summer temperatures >35degC and occasionally >40degC; in these conditions un-insulated dwellings are unable to provide safe conditions. In addition, such locations can have 1600W/m2 of solar radiation, further raising the temperature inside a dwelling, and in the case of Jordan winter temperatures of -10degC. In Thailand the high humidity is likely to be of equal importance in placing thermal stress on occupants. In addition, displacement shelters can use polymeric materials which contain a high proportion of VOCs such as plasticisers and release agents, and have poorly ventilated cooking facilities using fuels such as wood, thereby generating particulates.   Camps were once expected to be a short term solution, and this is still true in some settings. However, as witnessed in numerous locations around the globe, encampment often continues for years or decades (for example, the 340,000 strong Dadaab camp in Kenya opened in 1992).  Even in natural disasters delays in rebuilding can lead to displacement camps taking on aspects of semi-permanent settlement. The challenges of survival in the immediate onset of an emergency quickly give way to concerns about the suitability of shelter over a longer timeframe. Such basic dwellings inhibit domestic life, educational delivery to the young, and development of the social relations needed for community cohesion. Often the need of traumatised people for a sense of security and privacy also goes unmet. Unfortunately, even the state of the art in current shelter provision does not adequately consider building physics, thermal comfort and air quality. There is also a general lack of attention to socio-cultural issues. Thus, for example, our pilot study in Jordan has revealed through social surveys a consistent concern amongst the displaced population with the issues of safety and privacy.   Given the diversity of potentially available building materials, climates and cultures, there will be no single shelter solution, but rather a need for a systematic process of design that is cognisant of the climate, landscape, culture, length of time the accommodation might be needed, flexibility as family size changes and portability. This project will develop such a design process by creating a new science of shelter design through engagement with aid agency staff in four countries with diverse weather, cultural conditions and political sensitivities. This will involve 1) wide scale social and indoor environment surveys in five camps; 2) the construction of a series of potential designs in the UK, in a climate chamber and in Jordan; and 3) the production of a multi-language, extreme climate building physics-based, culturally sensitive, shelter design tool for agency field staff."", 'The Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) supports cutting-edge research to address challenges faced by developing countries.

This is especially acute among adolescent boys and girls attempting to access sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services. Growing risks related to SRH for this age group include sexual and gender-based violence, early marriage, and resulting SRH-related illnesses and deaths. Responding to these needs and creating effective prevention measures requires a context-specific, evidence-based framework upon which to base policies and actions. \n\nThis project is being implemented in collaboration with the Middle East and North Africa Health Policy Forum, an independent non-governmental forum to discuss health policy issues in the region. The aim of the project is to develop a regional, sustainable, gender-responsive, and evidence-based multi-sectoral adolescent sexual and reproductive health framework in West Bank and Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco. The framework will address adolescent SRH issues as they pertain to education, communication, social norms, and legal frameworks. \nUsing a gender and rights-based approach, this framework will be developed with different actors, including adolescent boys and girls, and will be tested and refined to optimize its uptake and influence. The project will produce position papers for each of the four countries, as well as targeted analyses and briefs for specific user groups. Key stakeholders include adolescent girls and boys, parents, educators, non-governmental organizations, health workers, and policymakers. \n\nExpected changes from the project include improvements in adolescent knowledge and understanding; awareness and agency with regards to sexual and reproductive health information and services; greater engagement across various sectors in a given country and across the four countries; and strengthened capacities to apply the framework by key stakeholders in each of the countries.', 'La région Moyen-Orient et Afrique du Nord traverse une période de transition imposée par les environnements politiques, démographiques, sociaux et économiques en changement.

Les principaux problèmes rencontrés en Ouganda pour la prise en charge des réfugiés incluent :\nLa protection de l’enfance : les leçons tirées du travail de Caritas avec les mineurs non-accompagnés dans les camps de réfugiés révèlent qu'il existe de nombreuses lacunes non comblées, notamment l'accès à la justice et le respect des lois internationales de protection à l’enfance. Les systèmes communautaires de protection de l'enfance sont faibles voire inexistants. \nLa violence sexuelle basée sur le genre (VSBG) : les évaluations menées ont révélé des retards dans la notification des cas de VSBG en raison de l'ignorance des mécanismes d'orientation, du manque d'intérêt des parents et de la rigidité culturelle qui mettent en péril la santé et l'avenir des victimes. Le manque de protection par rapport aux cas de viols, de violence domestique, de violence sexuelle et le sexe de survie constituent les risques principaux dans ce secteur.\nLa réintégration socio-économique : les entretiens avec des informateurs clés soulignent la nécessité d'étendre les activités socio-économiques dans les camps. Cependant le HCR a subi une réduction budgétaire de 17% entre 2020 et 2021 et le PAM a été obligé d’appliquer des réductions importantes au cash alimentaire (enveloppe réduite de UGX 31.000 à 19.000). Or les réfugiés dépendent très largement des rations alimentaires ou de leur équivalent en espèces pour survivre. Certains repartent dans leur pays d’origine par manque d’aide humanitaire en Ouganda.\nLe système judiciaire manque de financement et de ressources ; cela provoque une prestation de services légaux insuffisante et un accès marginal à la justice, en particulier pour les réfugiés. Il y aussi un retard significatif pour traiter les dossiers, notamment les dossiers des réfugiés. Cela décourage les victimes à se confier à la justice.\n La région de Diffa (Sud-Est) reste extrêmement volatile et fait face à de nombreux déplacements de population. À titre d’exemple, en avril 2021, suite aux attaques répétées à Damassak et à Gaidam (Nord du Nigéria), plus de 9.000 personnes ont trouvé refuge dans les localités de Chétimari et de Gagamari, avec une proportion importante d’enfants non accompagnés ; à Mainé Soroa, on dénombre plus de 6.000 personnes réfugiées ou déplacées. \nCette situation influence gravement la protection des personnes (réfugiés, déplacés, retournés et hôtes) et les mécanismes communautaires de protection. Les enfants sont particulièrement vulnérables et subissent de nombreux incidents tels que : séparation familiale, abandon, détresse psychologique, recrutement forcé par des groupes armés, exploitation et maltraitance par les marabouts, travail forcé, mariage précoce et forcé, sexe de survie et exploitation sexuelle. Le manque de documentation juridique et civile et les difficultés pour enregistrer les nouveau-nés posent également problème, notamment pour les déplacés internes.\nEn ce qui concerne les VBG, on relève notamment des cas de violences conjugales, ainsi que des harcèlements sexuels occasionnés le plus souvent au moment de la corvée d’eau et des besoins naturels aux alentours des villages.\nLa cohésion sociale entre les communautés est également fragilisée. Des tensions entre communautés ne sont pas rares (bagarres, invectives, stigmatisations, accusations de toutes sortes, conflits entre agriculteurs et éleveurs). Dans les centres urbains aussi, des tensions entre jeunes de différents quartiers débouchent fréquemment sur des bagarres violentes. Ces jeunes, souvent au chômage et déscolarisés, s’organisent en gangs et s’adonnent à différentes formes de banditisme : drogue, agressions, harcèlements, braquages, viols.\nA cette situation de crise sécuritaire s’ajoute une précarité économique des communautés suite à la fermeture des frontières avec le Nigeria (limitant les échanges). L’enchainement des déficits céréaliers et fourragers entraine une insécurité alimentaire cyclique et une baisse des revenus liés à la vente des animaux.\n Dix ans après le début de la crise syrienne, la Jordanie accueille toujours 665.404 réfugiés syriens enregistrés auprès du HCR. La très grande majorité, soit 80.7% de cette population, vit dans des zones urbaines et rurales, hors des camps de réfugiés.\nAvant même le début de la guerre en Syrie, le pays faisait déjà face à des problèmes de pauvreté extrême. Les femmes et les enfants en particulier sont parmi les plus vulnérables et ne peuvent compter sur un système de sécurité sociale défaillant. Ces groupes sont les premières victimes de la violence, notamment liée au genre, ainsi qu’en témoignent les taux très élevés de criminalité qui auxquels font face ces groupes. Les défis sont nombreux pour prévenir et répondre à cette violence, en ciblant particulièrement les enfants à risque, le travail des enfants et les mariages précoces.\nÀ cause de la crise économique régionale, exacerbée par la guerre en Syrie, les réfugiés syriens, tout comme les plus pauvres Jordaniens, ont épuisé leurs mécanismes de survie. Des études récentes montrent que depuis le début de la pandémie Covid-19, la pauvreté a augmenté de 38% au sein de la population jordanienne et de 18% pour les réfugiés syriens. \n Selon le HCR, plus de 400.000 réfugiés ont fui le pays depuis 2015, la Tanzanie étant leur principal pays d’accueil. Le choc lié à la pandémie de Covid-19 est venu interrompre une reprise économique fragile et a impacté la croissance économique estimée à 0,3 % en 2020 contre 1,8 % en 2019.\nLa population burundaise (y compris les déplacés internes et les personnes qui retournent dans leur région d’origine) souffre de plus en plus des effets de la dégradation de la situation socio-économique. Le niveau d’insécurité alimentaire, presque deux fois plus élevé que la moyenne des pays d’Afrique subsaharienne, est alarmant : environ 2 millions de personnes souffrent d’insécurité alimentaire. Près de la moitié de la population est touchée par la pauvreté multidimensionnelle, ce qui signifie qu’elle n’a pas ou peu accès aux services de base (santé, éducation) et que ses besoins essentiels ne sont pas satisfaits. Les femmes et les enfants sont particulièrement vulnérables aux risques de protection, notamment aux violences basées sur le genre (VBG) et à la traite des personnes. La santé reproductive des femmes et des filles, leur autonomisation et leur participation au marché du travail reste problématique dans l’ensemble du pays. Malgré le rôle essentiel qu’elles jouent pour assurer la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle des ménages, les femmes restent confrontées à un accès inéquitable aux facteurs de production, dont l'accès à la propriété foncière. Cette précarité structurelle est renforcée dans les situations de déplacement, notamment du fait de la diminution des moyens de subsistance et de l’accès aux services de base pouvant entrainer des stratégies risquées de survie et augmenter le risque de VBG et de traite des personnes."", 'Prévention et réduction des vulnérabilités des groupes les plus exposés aux violences lors de crises humanitaires à travers le renforcement d‘un environnement de protection accessible et digne.

For this purpose, SEK 35 million is proposed for 2021. \nThe proposed projects are expected to respond to identified humanitarian needs according to the global and national / regional analyzes carried out within Sida's latest process for allocating humanitarian funds to ongoing major humanitarian crises.

This is to enable an adaptive needs-based humanitarian response in complex and difficult-to-navigate environments. Overall, Sida believes that the added value of the increased flexibility, in the form of time and resource savings that through reduced number of change requests enables a faster, more adaptive and agile humanitarian response, exceeds the reduced detailed knowledge in the planned budgets. \nSida estimates that the funds for 2021 will be disbursed immediately. This is to best enable the planning and implementation of the humanitarian response without delay.\n\nThe programme takes conflict perspectives into account when designing, implementing and evaluating projects within the contribution yet the conflict management is seldom the principle aim of a project.\n\nThe programme takes gender perspectives into account when designing, implementing and evaluating projects within the contribution yet gender is seldom the principle aim of a project."", 'Detta beslut avser en större ändring av insats (Insatshanteringsregeln 3.5.2 §) mellan Sida och Islamic Relief Sverige för att möjliggöra följande under 2021: humanitärt stöd i 7 länder och stöd till Islamic Reliefs Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) för att snabbt kunna möta krisdrabbades behov i oförutsedda eller hastigt försämrade humanitära kriser.

Rapid Response Mechanism, RRM. För detta ändamål föreslås 35 MSEK för 2021. \n\nDe föreslagna projekten bedöms svara mot identifierade humanitära behov enligt de globala samt nationella/regionala analyser som genomförts inom Sidas senaste process för allokering av humanitära medel till pågående stora humanitära kriser. Fortsatt stöd till IR Sveriges humanitära insatser bedöms relevant för att uppnå målen i Strategi för Sveriges humanitära bistånd genom Sida 2021 - 2025.\n \nIslamic Relief ges i avtalet flexibilitet att omallokera upp till 10 procent mellan budgetrubriker i varje enskild projekt- och programbudget. Detta för att möjliggöra en adaptiv behovsbaserad humanitär respons i komplexa och svårnavigerade miljöer. Sammantaget bedömer Sida att mervärdet av den utökade flexibiliteten, i form av tids och resursbesparing som genom minskat antal förändringsförfrågningar möjliggör en snabbare, mer adaptiv och agil humanitär respons, överstiger den minskade detaljkännedomen i de planerade budgetarna. \nSida bedömer att medlen för 2021 ska utbetalas omgående.

Ur Sidas perspektiv har det förväntade resultatet av det samlade stödet till Islamic Relief varit att rädda liv, lindra nöd och upprätthålla mänsklig värdighet, till förmån för nödlidande, baserat på identifierade humanitära behov hos utsatta grupper i prioriterade länder. Utöver stöd genom planerbara program, förmedlades även stöd via en så kallad snabbinsatsmekanism som möjliggjorde att Islamic Relief kunde ge omedelbart humanitärt stöd efter plötsliga eller förvärrade kriser. Dessa snabbinsatsstöd hade därmed ytterligare ett förväntat resultat; att snabbt nå fram till nödlidande.\n\nIslamic har under femårsperioden genomfört ett stort antal humanitära program i 21 länder. Att definiera några få, specifika och uppföljningsbara mål för en så pass omfattande portfölj i enlighet med SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely) är naturligtvis svårt. Verksamhetens geografiska inriktning har dessutom medvetet tillåtits vara flexibel för att möjliggöra årliga prioriteringar, baserat på aktuella humanitära behov. Islamic Relief har istället valt att presentera uppföljningsbara mål och årliga verksamhetsplaner för varje specifikt land där de genomfört verksamhet.

Through this funding support, ID began to implement the programme, “Nothing About Us Without Us: Supporting Refugee Leadership in Diplomacy” in April 2024. We developed our programme with full recognition of the challenges that refugees, the refugee-led organizations (RLOs) which represent them, and host communities experience in accessing the policy space at multiple levels. We seek to leverage our track record of advancing Meaningful Refugee Participation (MRP) at the global level to advance the meaningful participation of refugees and host communities in diplomatic processes in the countries that host the highest numbers of refugees, namely: Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Türkiye, and Uganda. \r\n\r\nThe integrated objectives of our programme are threefold: \r\n\r\n(I)\tEnable local organizations, in particular refugee-led organizations, networks and advocates to access the political space to make their voices heard and increase their operational impact to provide lasting and sustainable solutions for refugees and other displaced populations in regions of origin. \r\n(II)\tStrengthen refugee-led organizations’ expertise and capacity to independently influence political negotiations and build policy coherence from the international level to the local level.\r\n(III)\tProvide long-term core funding to RLOs to ensure their ability to: launch sustained policy and advocacy initiatives, ensure their operational resilience, and advance the self-reliance of refugees and host communities\r\n\r\nDuring Year 1 of this programme (1 April 2024-31 December 2024), we laid the groundwork for achieving these objectives in future years for this programme (2025-2029), to contribute to the Migration and Displacement 2023-2028 grant’s broader policy objectives on (i) protection refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), (ii) access to education and training for displaced persons and host communities, (iii) promoting economic development and job opportunities, and (iv) access to improved services, facilities and information systems for displaced persons and host communities. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, we conducted a robust mapping of stakeholders to identify potential partnerships and collaborations with local and national actors in each focus country. We also launched an open and inclusive partnership selection process to identify refugee-led organizations in each focus country as in-country partners for this programme, resulting in selecting 9 in-country partners in 4 out of the 6 focus countries for this programme (Egypt, Kenya, Turkiye, and Uganda) as of the end of 2024. We also began testing our approach for the wider programme by implementing activities on facilitating refugees' access to the policy space. \r\n\r\nFor instance, \r\n\t- We supported two RLOs in Egypt to engage with diplomatic missions in Geneva, leading up to Egypt’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) on 19 November 2024. These two RLOs developed a policy paper containing recommendations regarding Egypt’s asylum and migration policies, which they subsequently shared with diplomatic missions in Geneva and Brussels which raised migration and refugee issues in previous cycles of the UPR.\r\n-\tWe facilitated the participation of 2 representatives of RLOs based in Uganda at the African Union (AU) 12th Annual Humanitarian Symposium between 19-21 November 2024, and the AU Sudan Forum on 18 November, both held in Nairobi, Kenya. We conducted a strategy session ahead of the event to brief them on the event and prepare them to make effective and impactful interventions. We distilled the outcomes of this strategy session into a briefing pack for these leaders to enable them to participate effectively at the event, including key messages and talking points that we jointly developed with the leaders based on their specific policy priorities.""]",['Independent Diplomat'],"['Government of the Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Independent Diplomat', 'Independent Diplomat']",d3b700e197237399147b76e2e5daf5c2,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Egypt', 'Ethiopia', 'Jordan', 'Kenya', 'Türkiye', 'Uganda', 'Geneva', 'Brussels', 'Nairobi']","['humanitarian', 'development']",['Government of the Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs'],['Independent Diplomat'],2025-06-04T10:07:40.764283

Utöver sin operativa roll i skyddet av flyktingar (juridisk hjälp, utfärda identitetshandlingar, asylrätt, etc) har UNHCR en normativ roll i övervakning och tolkning av flyktingkonventionen. UNHCR är inom humanitära systemet huvudaktören i alla flyktingkriser, med övergripande koordineringsansvar av FN- och civilsamhällsorganisationers humanitära arbete samt ansvarar för samarbete med nationella och lokala myndigheter. I dagsläget omfattar detta koordinering av flera regionala flyktingappeller så som Syrien, Afrikas horn, Nigeria, Sydsudan, Jemen, Centralafrikanska republiken, Burundi och i Europa.\n\nI humanitära kriser inom ett lands gränser ansvarar ""United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)"" för koordineringen av den humanitära responsen, detta gäller även internflyktingkriser (Internally displaced People crisis). UNHCR ansvarar i dessa kriser för att leda och samordna arbetet i tre kluster (sektoriella koordineringsgrupper); skyddsklustret, klustret för ”Camp Coordination and Camp Management”, samt ”Emergency Shelter” klustret. UNHCR bidrar därmed till det humanitära systemet globalt, regionalt och nationellt. Utöver detta, och när situationen tillåter, arbetar UNHCR också för hållbara lösningar för flyktingar.\n\nGenom sitt stöd till UNHCR 2020 bidrar Sida till att bistå flyktingar och internflyktingar så att dessa får skydd mot förföljelse och våld, tak över huvudet och basförnödenheter (mat, vatten, hygien, primärsjukvård, etc.) Vidare bidrar Sida till strategisk samordning inom det humanitära systemet. \n\nSidas finansiella bidrag till UNHCR 2020 omfattar totalt 250 MSEK, varav 30 MSEK specifikt har gått till den globala covid-19-responsplanen.\nSida beslutar om detta stöd, som komplement till regeringens årliga kärnbidrag. Sidas stöd går till FNs konsoliderade humanitära appeller (Humanitarian Response Plans), UNHCRs Globala appell och UNHCRs tilläggsbudgetar (Supplementary Appeals) samt Regionala flyktingappeller (Regional Refugee Response Plans). Sida öronmärker genom avtal bidraget till UNHCR på land/region nivå men stödet är oöronmärkt inom denna nivå. Sida har under året även möjlighet att ta ställning till ytterligare stöd genom tilläggsbeslut.\n\nDen största delen av stödet utbetalas i början av året för att UNHCR ska ges förutsättningar att planera och genomföra humanitära insatser utan fördröjning. UNHCR omsätter regelmässigt utbetalda medel i nära anslutning till utbetalning och förbrukar gåvomedel inom verksamhetsåret. Den föreslagna betalningsplanen överensstämmer således med Sidas insatshanteringsregel, avsnitt 2.8.4, där det föreskrivs att betalningen kommer att ske i nära anslutning till den tidpunkt då pengarna kommer att användas och som finansieringsbehoven uppstår. Ett avsteg från Sidas allmänna rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms motiverat.\n\nBedömningspromemorian har skrivits på engelska med anledning av att engelskspråkig personal i fält är delaktig i beredning och uppföljning av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirektörens beslut om Sidas språkvalsmatris med tillämpningsanvisningar från den 1 mars 2013.', ""Sida has assessed the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as a relevant and strategic humanitarian partner with good implementation capacity. Sida’s Central Organisational Assessment of UNHCR (2015) concludes that the organisation’s systems for internal control are adequate according and in line with Sida contribution regulations. \n\nSida provides support, in addition to the MFA's annual core contribution, based on the UN Consolidated Appeals (HRP) and UNHCRs Global Appeal, Supplementary Budget Appeals and UNHCR Regional Response Plans (RRRP). Sida allocates funding to UNHCR on a country / regional level and support is unearmarked at this level. During the year Sida assesses UNHCR's Supplementary Appeals for possible additional funding through supplementary decisions.\n\nWith its mandate, to protect refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people, and assist in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third country, UNHCR is alongside ICRC Sida’s key protection partner. In addition to its operational role in the protection of refugees, UNHCR has a normative role in monitoring and interpreting the Refugee Convention. UNHCR is the lead Agency in Refugee operations within the humanitarian system with responsibility to coordinate UN agencies and NGOs response in refugee crisis. This includes coordination of several regional refugee appeals such as Syria, Horn of Africa, Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen, CAR, Burundi and Europe.\n\nUNHCR coordinates its response under OCHA in emergency within countries (internally displaced people). UNHCR is responsible for leading and coordinating the Protection Cluster, the clusters of Camp Coordination and Camp Management, as well as the Emergency Shelter cluster. UNHCR is thereby contributing strategically to the humanitarian system, at global, regional and country level.\n\nThrough this support Sida contributes humanitarian funding to UNHCR in order to assist refugees and internally displaced people in armed conflict, providing legal protection from persecution and violence, emergency shelter (tents, semi-permanent structures, rent for temporary accommodation) and basic necessities (such as food, water, hygiene and primary health care, etc), as well as opportunities for durable solutions, when the situation so allows. \n\nThe country allocations for 2019 includes a total of 250 MSEK, including 30 MSEK to the global COVID-19 response plan.\n\nTo facilitate rapid humanitarian planning and response, disbursement the main part of the amount is made at the beginning of the year after signing of the Agreement and upon disbursement request from UNHCR. Funds are utilized within a short timeframe after disbursement and UNHCR has a general utilization rate of 98% of the annual contributions. It is Sida's experience that funds available for activities at the country level rarely reaches or exceeds UNHCR's total funding needs. The funding level for UNHCR is generally about 50% of the annual budget. In the exceptional case that UNHCR has not utilized the entire Sida contribution by the end of the year, Sida has been duly informed and the balance have been regulated in accordance with the agreement. The proposed payment plan is thus in line with Sida's rule for contribution management § 2.8.4, which stipulates that payment will be made in close connection with the time when the funds will be used, and as the funding needs arise."", 'Each year, Sida makes loosely earmarked contributions to UNHCR\'s crisis-specific Refugee Response Plans, based on Sida\'s model for allocation of humanitarian aid and in response to prioritized humanitarian needs through Sida\'s own Humanitarian Crisis Analyses.\nThe specific objectives of the individual response plans supported may vary from one crisis to another. Nevertheless, they always align with UNHCR\'s overall mandate and objective to provide protection and assistance to refugees and other persons of concern to the UNHCR. According to the Mission Statement ""The High Commissioner for refugees is mandated by the UN to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems. UNHCRs primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees.""\nThe operations are sorted under four main pillars: 1) Refugee Programme 2) Stateless Programme 3) Reintegration Projects 4) IDP Projects\nThe individual response plans also contribute to UNHCR\'s Global Strategic Priorities, as set out in the UNHCR Global Appeal. These take into account the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as the commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit and under the Grand Bargain.\n\nIt is Sida\'s assessment that the support has contributed to the organisations overall objective to provide protection and assistance to refugees Based on field visit conducted by Sida to UNHCR operations, Sida and UNHCR technical meetings and Sida participation in Swedish delegation at UNHCR Executive/Standing Committee it is Sida\'s assessment that UNHCR has progressed well in achieving its defined goals.']",['Sweden'],"['Sweden', 'UNHCR/United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency', 'UNHCR/United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees']",42cd357328494022bf4708d13b695da3,"['Syria', 'mixed_or_unspecified_refugees']",['refugees'],[],"['Syria', 'Horn of Africa', 'Nigeria', 'South Sudan', 'Yemen', 'CAR', 'Burundi', 'Europe']",['humanitarian'],"['Sweden', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency']",['UNHCR/United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees'],2025-06-04T10:11:47.245206

DRC föreslår att använda Sidas medel till akuta humanitära insatser i Puntland och South Central regionen.\n- I Myanmar föreslår Sida att stödja DRC med 3 MSEK jämfört med 6 MSEK under 2013. DRC föreslår att använda Sidas medel till Sydöstra Myanmar (Kayha och Kayinstaterna).\n- I Centralafrikanska Republiken föreslår Sida att stödja DRC med 7 MSEK vilket är samma summa som föregående år. Till följd av politiska oroligheter med utbrott av våldsamheter sedan i mars 2013, har de rådande förhållandena betydligt försvårat för humanitära aktörer att utöva sin verksamhet.

I konkreta termer säkerställer ERFerna denna flexibilitet och operationell responshastighet genom följande: \n\n1) Snabb finansiering närhelst under året. \nDetta möjliggörs genom att humanitära aktörer inte behöver äska medel då man redan har en pooled fond i landet som är redo att snabbt allokeras när krisen uppstår. Förutom själva fonden är även de administrativa och beslutsfattande processerna redan etablerade vilket möjliggör för relativs snabba handläggninsprocesser samt snabba beslut av OCHA i samarbete med Humanitarian Country Team.\n\n2) Finansiering av NGO.\nERFen har som huvudsyfte att finansiera NGOs.

Ansökan avser en ettårig förlängning för 2018 av den pågående insatsen som genomförs under avtalsperioden 2015-2017. \n\nDen totala budgetökningen uppgår till 3,2 MKR  (4,8 %) jämfört med 2017 års budget. Det ansökta bidraget ökar med 14,5 MKR (32%), jämfört med beviljat bidrag 2017. Ökningen beror till stor del på att IM minskar sin egeninsats från 22 % till 13 %,  och till viss del att IM anpassar sin verksamhet mot den nya CSO-strategin. \n\nIM avser att inkomma med en flerårsansökan för 2019-2023. I den planerar IM att ansöka om 80 miljoner år 2019, med en gradvis ökning på årsbasis fram till 2023. Samtidigt vill IM minska egeninsatsen från 22%, i pågående insats, till 13% för 2018 och 10% från och med 2019.\n\nProgrammet avseende ansökan 2018 kommer i stort sett att fortsätta som tidigare och baseras på samma ramverk, resultat, strategier och insatser som i föregående fas. Resultatramverket har uppdaterats och inkluderar resultat för 2018.\n\nIM:s långsiktiga mål är att människor som lever i fattigdom och utanförskap världen över ska ha möjlighet att hävda sina ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella rättigheter, och leva ett värdigt liv. \n\nAnsökan till Sida avser enbart IM:s verksamhet i utvecklingsländer, ej den verksamhet som bedrivs i Sverige. I den internationella verksamheten fokuserar IM på ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella rättigheter. Arbetet är indelat i följande fyra områden som är nära sammanlänkade och ömsesidigt förstärkande: utbildning, hälsa, försörjning och civila samhället.\n\nIM gör geografiska prioriteringar utifrån tre kriterier: 1) förutsättningarna för att IM ska kunna ge ett mervärde, 2) nivån av fattigdom och utanförskap, och 3) ekonomiska hänsyn som t.ex. kostnadseffektivitet. IM fokuserar på följande regioner och länder:\n\n- Centralamerika (Guatemala och El Salvador)\n- Mellanöstern (Jordanien och Palestina)\n- Södra Asien (Indien och Nepal)\n- Södra Afrika (Malawi, Zimbabwe och Zambia)\n- Moldavien\n\nFörutom de geografiska strategierna innehåller ansökan strategin för programmet IM Fair Trade Producer Development, som har som syfte att stärka organisationer och småföretag att bli medlemmar av Worlds Fair Trade Organisation, genom rådgivning i organisationsfrågor, arbetsrätt och produktutveckling.\n\nUtöver de resultat som IM avser att uppnå inom de tematiska områdena och programmet Fair Trade Producer Development tydliggör IM i sin ansökan för 2018 att förlängningsåret är ett år för utvärdering, reflektion och strategisk planering. Tonvikten under året kommer att vara att utforska IM:s roll och mervärde som givare och partner. Under året ska IM internt reflektera över lärdomar, revidera tillvägagångssätt och metoder, revidera partnerportföljer och granska närvaron i IM:s verksamhetsländer. \n\nANSÖKANDE ORGANISATION\nIM är en medlemsbaserad svensk ideell biståndsorganisation som arbetar för en rättvis och medmänsklig värld. IM:s ändamål är att synliggöra och bekämpa fattigdom och utanförskap. \n\nOrganisationen bildades 1938 som en reaktion på det förtryck, hat, våld och fascism som då präglade Europa. Högsta beslutande organ är årsmötet, som utser styrelsen. IM har idag ca 6800 medlemmar och ett stort antal volontärer är engagerade, främst i verksamheten i Sverige. 2016 var den totala insamlingen, exklusive offentliga bidrag drygt 73 miljoner kronor. De offentliga bidragen uppgick till 62 miljoner kronor, varav Sidas andel upgick till cirka 70 %. IM:s intäkter för 2016 uppgick sammanlagt till strax under 135 miljoner kronor.  IM antogs som ramorganisation år 2013 och den aktuella ansökan avser en förlängning av den första avtalsperioden som ramorganisation. \n\nIM bedriver internationellt utvecklingssamarbete, integrationsarbete i Sverige och handelssamarbeten inom ramen för fair trade. IM verkar i regionerna Centralamerika, Europa, Mellanöstern, Södra Afrika, Sydasien och Sverige. Den internationella verksamheten genomförs främst tillsammans med partnerorganisationer eller i samverkan med andra aktörer. \n\nHuvudkontoret ligger i Lund och det finns 5 regionkontor runt om i landet som arbetar med verksamheten i Sverige. Den internationella verksamheten har genomgått en stor regionaliserings- och decentraliseringsprocess. Idag består den internationella avdelningen av sju personer på huvudkontoret i Lund, fyra regionala kontor och sju landkontor. Under 2016 var det totala antalet anställda på region- och landkontor 87 personer. IM hade under 2016 totalt 175 anställda. \n\nIM:s arbete genomsyras av ett rättighetsperspektiv. Från att tidigare ha genomfört de flesta insatser själva, stödjer IM numera lokala civilsamhällesorganisationer i samarbetsländerna i deras arbete att uppnå sina egna mål. Verksamhetens fokus har förflyttats från individnivå till att åstadkomma förändringar på organisationsnivå och institutionell nivå.\n\nI ansökan understryker IM att år 2018 är ett år för lärande och utveckling. Ett exempel på detta är att IM under slutet av 2017 planerar att ersätta det övergripande styrdokument, den strategiska plattformen 2011–2020, med ett nytt dokument: ""IM 2030"". IM 2030 visar de övergripande strategiska ambitionerna för IM inom fyra områden: organisation, kommunikation, utvecklingsarbete och ekonomisk tillväxt under 2018–2030. De strategiska ambitionerna kommer att operationaliseras genom konkreta mål av varje avdelning i deras respektive femåriga strategier. Den internationella avdelningen är decentraliserad och detta är en process som pågått under flera år. Arbetet med att få den nya organisationen att fungera fullt ut är ett pågående utvecklingsarbete där IM kontinuerligt fortsätter att identifiera och implementera nya arbetssätt. \n\nSIDAS SAMLADE STÖD TILL ORGANISATIONEN\nUtöver bidrag inom CSO-strategin erhåller IM stöd inom strategin för informations- och kommunikationsverksamhet i civilsamhället 2016-2022. Detta stöd har under perioden 2015-2107 uppgått till 4 600 000 kronor. För 2018 har IM ansökt om en förlängning av detta stöd om 1 727 000 kronor.\n\nBEREDNING\nEftersom ansökan avser en förlängning av pågående avtalsperiod 2015-2017 bereds insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. \n\nSida har haft tillgång till ett omfattande underlag för beredningen av insatsen, till exempel stickprovsrevision av avtalsefterlevnad 2017, tematiskt stickprov av integreringen av jämställdhetsperspektiven 2017, reserapporter från uppföljningsresor, Sidas interna ställningstaganden till finansiella och narrativa rapporter under pågående avtal, årsrapporter samt årlig avvikelserapportering.  \n\nEftersom insatsen bereds som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut har beredningen utgått från den tidigare beredning som gjordes av ansökan för den pågående avtalsperioden 2015-2017. I de fall bedömningar är fortsatt relevanta har dessa behållits och vid behov kompletterats. Sidas insatshanteringssystem Trac har förändrats sedan 2014 då beredningen av ansökan 2015-2017 gjordes vilket gör att det tillkommit frågor som inte fanns då. I beredningen anges vilka bedömningar som gjorts 2015-2017 och vilka som tillkommit i beredningen av ansökan inför 2018.Om inte annat anges är riskbedömningarna i riskregistret uppdaterade utifrån ansökan 2018. Beredningen för ansökan 2015-2017 gjordes på engelska, denna tilläggsansökan har beretts på svenska på grund av språklagen. \n\nDe pågående dialogmålen från ansökan 2015-2017 är: 1) Cross-cutting issues are mainstreamed in IM´s operations 2) Increased aid efficiency, 3) Further development of IM´s riskanalysis and riskmanagement. Dessa dialogmål har analyserats under relevanta avsnitt i beredningen. Ett fjärde dialogmål, som identifierades i beredningen av ansökan 2015-2017 ”Application and continued development of the Right Based Approach” har Sida bedömt som uppfyllt. Rättighetsperspektivet är dock något som Sida kommer att fortsätta att följa som en del av den ordinarie uppföljningen.', ""Women, men, girls and boys living in poverty and exclusion in developing countries (and in Sweden) have increased their ability to claim their economic, social and cultural rights and thereby enhanced their ability to sustain a life in dignity.

For this purpose, SEK 35 million is proposed for 2021. \nThe proposed projects are expected to respond to identified humanitarian needs according to the global and national / regional analyzes carried out within Sida's latest process for allocating humanitarian funds to ongoing major humanitarian crises. Continued support for IR Sweden's humanitarian efforts is deemed relevant to achieve the goals in the Strategy for Sweden's humanitarian aid through Sida 2021 - 2025.\n \nIslamic Relief is given the flexibility in the agreement to reallocate up to 10 percent between budget lines in each individual project and program budget. This is to enable an adaptive needs-based humanitarian response in complex and difficult-to-navigate environments. Overall, Sida believes that the added value of the increased flexibility, in the form of time and resource savings that through reduced number of change requests enables a faster, more adaptive and agile humanitarian response, exceeds the reduced detailed knowledge in the planned budgets. \nSida estimates that the funds for 2021 will be disbursed immediately. This is to best enable the planning and implementation of the humanitarian response without delay.\n\nThe programme takes conflict perspectives into account when designing, implementing and evaluating projects within the contribution yet the conflict management is seldom the principle aim of a project.\n\nThe programme takes gender perspectives into account when designing, implementing and evaluating projects within the contribution yet gender is seldom the principle aim of a project."", 'Detta femåriga program genomfördes under perioden 2017-2021. Ur Sidas perspektiv har det förväntade resultatet av det samlade stödet till Islamic Relief varit att rädda liv, lindra nöd och upprätthålla mänsklig värdighet, till förmån för nödlidande, baserat på identifierade humanitära behov hos utsatta grupper i prioriterade länder. Utöver stöd genom planerbara program, förmedlades även stöd via en så kallad snabbinsatsmekanism som möjliggjorde att Islamic Relief kunde ge omedelbart humanitärt stöd efter plötsliga eller förvärrade kriser. Dessa snabbinsatsstöd hade därmed ytterligare ett förväntat resultat; att snabbt nå fram till nödlidande.\n\nIslamic har under femårsperioden genomfört ett stort antal humanitära program i 21 länder. Att definiera några få, specifika och uppföljningsbara mål för en så pass omfattande portfölj i enlighet med SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely) är naturligtvis svårt.

OCHAs högsta chef Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) är formellt ansvarig för etablerandet och avvecklandet av dessa fonder, samt för deras operationella effektivitet. På landnivå är den av ERC utsedda humanitäre koordinatorn (HC) ansvarig för respektive fond. Den humanitäre koordinatorns ansvar är av central betydelse då det stärker den humanitära samordningen i fält, vilket är nödvändigt pga av det ständigt ökade antalet humanitära aktörer. Detta regleras i de Globala riktlinjerna vilka är obligatoriska för samtliga humanitära landfonder. De Globla riktlinjerna som är obligatoriska att följa för samtliga fonder lanserades av OCHAs högsta chef (ERC) i februari 2015. Dessa har under 2017 reviderats och stärkts på ett antal punkter, inte minst inom riskhanteringssystemet (som till exemplen stärker fondernas arbete med anti-korruption och uppföljning på projektnivå).  \n\nGivare har en rådgivande funktion i landfonderna genom den landbaserade styrgruppen ”Advisory Board (AB)” samt det globala rådgivande forumet ”Pooled Fund Working Group (PFWG)”, som båda sköts av OCHA. Sida har en stark tradition att vara aktiv i bägge sammanhangen genom ambassaderna och den humanitära enhetens fortlöpande arbete på nationell och global nivå. Sida har dessutom sedan 2013 etablerat rutiner för reguljär uppföljning av de humanitära landfonderna samt stärkt länken mellan projektuppföljningen i fält och konkreta dialogfrågor som förs på global nivå. Under 2017 följde Sida upp 16 av 18 landfonder (ej Centralafrikanska republiken och Jemen). \n\nSverige har sedan upprättandet av den första CBPFen (1997 i Angola) varit en pådrivande kraft i stärkandet av de humanitära landfonderna. Det svenska finansiella och politiska stödet till fonderna har ytterligare stärkts med åren, då frågan om lokal förankring samt humanitär samordning blivit centrala i ”Strategin för Sveriges humanitära bistånd genom Styrelsen för internationellt utvecklingssamarbete (Sida) 2017-2020”. År 2015 förstärktes denna position ytterligare genom en internationell högnivå panel om humanitär finansiering som tillsats av FNs Generalsekreterare och i vilken utrikesminister Margot Wallström deltog. En av panelens huvudrekommendationer var att öka stödet till de humanitära landfonderna i syfte att effektivisera det humanitära systemet.\n\nVal av CBPFer för Sida stöd har skett på basis av Sidas behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess. I vilken humanitära kriser i världen analyseras utifrån de humanitära principerna, i synnerhet opartiskhets principen. Sedan föreslås de mest relevanta partners för stöd i respektive kris. Den planerade insatsen att stödja FNs humanitära landfonder är avstämt med UD inom ramen för HUMSAM och är i linje med 2018 års humanitära allokering. Sverige är idag globalt den tredje största givaren till CBPFerna. \n\nSida kommer att inom ramen för denna beredning ingå avtal med två parter, då fonderna formellt administreras av OCHA respektive Multi Partner Trust Fund Office/United Nations Development Programme (MPTFO/UNDP). \n\nAvtalet 2018 med OCHA gäller elva humanitära landfonder som inbegrips i ett och samma avtal och som följer samma format som tidigare års avtal med OCHA. \n\nLandfördelningen är följande: Etiopien (35 MSEK), Irak (15 MSEK), Jemen (50 MSEK), Myanmar (10 MSEK), Pakistan (23 MSEK), Syrien (20 MSEK), Jordanien/Syrenkrisen (20 MSEK), Libanon/Syrienkrisen (15 MSEK),Turkiet/Syrienkrisen (25 MSEK) Palestina (15 MSEK) och Nigeria (20 MSEK). \n\nLandfördelningen för avtalet 2018 med MPTFO/UNDP är följande: Afghanistan (60 MSEK), Central Afrikanska Republiken (12 MSEK), Demokratiska Republiken Kongo (80 MSEK), Syd Sudan (48 MSEK), Sudan (57 MSEK), samt Somalia (35 MSEK). \n\nSida föreslås besluta om ytterligare finansiering 2018 med 540 000 000 SEK (varav 24 MSEK beslutats om tidigare) i ett kompletterande insatsbeslut till nuvarande avtal med OCHA samt ett tilläggsavtal med MPTFO/UNDP till sammanlagt sjutton landfonder. Sida bedömer att samtliga medel skall utbetalas i början på året för att på bästa sätt möjliggöra planering och genomförande av humanitära insatser utan fördröjning. \n\nGenom en enhetlig beredning som inbegriper alla sjutton fonder stärks den humanitära enhets kapacitet att arbeta mer systematiskt med de sjutton fonderna. Främst genom jämförande landanalyser samt en sammanhållen uppföljningsstruktur, i vilken ambassader och den humanitära enheten ingår. En annan fördel med sammanslagningen av beredningen är att ambassaderna kan frigöra ytterligare resurser till fortlöpande uppföljning av fondernas effektivitet i fält, samt att Sida kan fokusera ytterligare på strategiska frågor inom ramen för de nationella rådgivande styrgrupperna, ”Advisory Boards”. Det bör även understrykas att arbetet med beredningen skett i nära samarbete med berörda ambassader.', 'The CBPFs are an important tool for effective humanitarian response   as they prioritize a) quick release of funds, b) NGOs i.e. nimbleness and speed and c)local actors that can access hard to reach areas.', 'The outcomes of the CBPFs are to:\nA) Improve effectiveness of the humanitarian response by directing funding towards\npriority humanitarian needs.

ACAPS fokuserar på humanitära behovsbedömningar medan IDMC har ett skyddsfokus med specifik inriktning på internflyktingar. \n\nFör 2016 föreslås att 17 länder från 2015 kvarstår medan CAR, Nigeria och Syrien tillkommer i och med ansökan för 2016. Burkina Faso och Ukraina fick stöd 2015 men faller bort 2016. Verksamhetsmässigt har vissa förändringar gjorts i vissa landstöd vilket är naturligt då behov vanligen förändras under ett krisförlopp. RRM-stödet föreslås uppgå till 20,000,000 då NRC är en viktig partner för Sidas möjlighet att snabbt ge humanitärt stöd i hastigt uppkomma kriser.\n\nInom ramen för avtalet allokerades initialt SEK 138,000,000 för 2014, 10,000,000 för 2015 och 10,000,000 för 2016.

For the 1.5 billion people living in FCASs (1), livelihood challenges and rising food, fertilizer, and input prices (2) are compounded by climate change, unsustainable resource consumption, poor governance, and weak social cohesion (3,4,5). Conflict and forced migration often result from, and further escalate, these challenges. Economic disruptions, such as those caused by COVID-19 and the Ukraine-Russia War, are sparking the risk of food and nutrition crises and poverty and conflict traps. Nearly 670 million people are projected to face hunger in 2030 — 8 % of the world population, and the same as in 2015 when the 2030&nbsp;Agenda and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched (6). </p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">By mid-2021, 84 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide; 80% of them experience acute food insecurity and high levels of malnutrition (7,8). Migration is an important development tool; it can support livelihoods, build resilience, and protect against fragility and conflict — particularly for youth (9,10). However, migration can strain FLWSs and create challenges for those left behind — especially women facing increased work burdens alongside insufficient decision-making authority and limited access to key assets and services (11,12). Currently, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) host 83% of the world’s refugees (9). Host communities struggle to provide livelihood opportunities for all; new arrivals often strain local infrastructure and services, put pressure on natural resources and the environment, and increase competition for jobs.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">By 2021, most food crises were due to conflict and insecurity (5). On average, 30% of the population in countries facing protracted crises lives in extreme poverty (&lt;$1.90/day), compared to ~6% in LMICs overall (13). Climate change and social inequalities exacerbate conflict. Climate change is rapidly intensifying, increasing pressure on livelihoods and ecosystems (14). In 2020, about 25% of internally displaced people were displaced by conflict and violence, and the remainder by disasters, mostly weather-related (15). Social inequalities further increase risks of hunger and reduce access to benefits from FLWSs, while serving as structural constraints to stability and peace (16,17, 18). Women are disproportionately negatively affected by shocks and crises and have less access to channels of power and influence that could help them benefit from programming addressing these issues. Failure to address interactions between climate stress and human-made crises will escalate both problems. </p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Governments and development organizations demand evidence to address these complex global crises. Poor governance and weak access to basic services, common features of FCASs, severely limit policy effectiveness and require novel solutions. &nbsp;The recent “Global Food Crisis Report 2022” highlighted the need to fill data gaps so that research and evidence guide proposed policy solutions <em>as well as </em>contextually appropriate implementation (5). And the Committee on World Food Security High Level Panel of Experts has called for a globally coordinated response to both address the humanitarian crisis and build more resilient FLWSs (19).</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">A systems approach in partnership with those working in FCASs — incorporating women’s and youth’s voices — is needed to devise practical solutions that promote gender equity and social inclusion (GESI). CGIAR is uniquely positioned to generate evidence to support more effective and transformative policies and programming to enhance FLWS resilience in FCASs facing migration-related challenges, and to promote social equity, conflict mitigation, and peacebuilding (20).</p><p><br></p>']",['CGIAR'],['CGIAR'],5fd78f5200740b9d72da439c78b6092f,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']",[],"['Ukraine', 'low- and middle-income countries']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['United Kingdom', 'Norway', 'Japan', 'Switzerland', 'CCGIAR Fund']",['CGIAR'],2025-06-04T10:15:57.249922

UNHCR is thereby contributing strategically to the humanitarian system, at global, regional and country level.\n\nThrough this support Sida contributes humanitarian funding to UNHCR in order to assist refugees and internally displaced people in armed conflict, providing legal protection from persecution and violence, emergency shelter (tents, semi-permanent structures, rent for temporary accommodation) and basic necessities (such as food, water, hygiene and primary health care, etc), as well as opportunities for durable solutions, when the situation so allows. \n\nThe country allocations for 2019 includes a total of 250 MSEK, including 30 MSEK to the global COVID-19 response plan.\n\nTo facilitate rapid humanitarian planning and response, disbursement the main part of the amount is made at the beginning of the year after signing of the Agreement and upon disbursement request from UNHCR. Funds are utilized within a short timeframe after disbursement and UNHCR has a general utilization rate of 98% of the annual contributions. It is Sida's experience that funds available for activities at the country level rarely reaches or exceeds UNHCR's total funding needs. The funding level for UNHCR is generally about 50% of the annual budget. In the exceptional case that UNHCR has not utilized the entire Sida contribution by the end of the year, Sida has been duly informed and the balance have been regulated in accordance with the agreement. The proposed payment plan is thus in line with Sida's rule for contribution management § 2.8.4, which stipulates that payment will be made in close connection with the time when the funds will be used, and as the funding needs arise."", 'Each year, Sida makes loosely earmarked contributions to UNHCR\'s crisis-specific Refugee Response Plans, based on Sida\'s model for allocation of humanitarian aid and in response to prioritized humanitarian needs through Sida\'s own Humanitarian Crisis Analyses.\nThe specific objectives of the individual response plans supported may vary from one crisis to another. Nevertheless, they always align with UNHCR\'s overall mandate and objective to provide protection and assistance to refugees and other persons of concern to the UNHCR. According to the Mission Statement ""The High Commissioner for refugees is mandated by the UN to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems. UNHCRs primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees.""\nThe operations are sorted under four main pillars: 1) Refugee Programme 2) Stateless Programme 3) Reintegration Projects 4) IDP Projects\nThe individual response plans also contribute to UNHCR\'s Global Strategic Priorities, as set out in the UNHCR Global Appeal. These take into account the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as the commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit and under the Grand Bargain.\n\nIt is Sida\'s assessment that the support has contributed to the organisations overall objective to provide protection and assistance to refugees Based on field visit conducted by Sida to UNHCR operations, Sida and UNHCR technical meetings and Sida participation in Swedish delegation at UNHCR Executive/Standing Committee it is Sida\'s assessment that UNHCR has progressed well in achieving its defined goals.']",['Sweden'],"['Sweden', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency']",ed52439a825e4a70949b495ae8d56305,"['Syria', 'mixed_or_unspecified_refugees']",['refugees'],"['camp', 'urban', 'rural']","['Syria', 'Horn of Africa', 'Nigeria', 'South Sudan', 'Yemen', 'CAR', 'Burundi', 'Europe']",['humanitarian'],"['Sweden', 'Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency']",['The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)'],2025-06-04T10:16:25.615267

Beslutet tas i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel paragraf 3.11.3. och avser andra året av ett treårigt avtal.\n\nNRC är en stor humanitär organisation som arbetar inom de sex kärnkompetensområden tillfälligt boende, försörjningsmöjligheter och matsäkerhet, utbildning, vatten och sanitet, organisering av flyktingläger och juridisk rådgivning. Deras målgrupp omfattar i första hand flyktingar och internflyktingar men också, när relevant, värdsamhällen och återvändande.\n\nNRC är en viktig partner för Sida då organisationen verkar i några av världens svåraste humanitära kriser, och har en stor insatsstyrka som snabbt kan befinna sig på plats i en krissituation. NRC är för tillfället närvarande i 31 länder, och har en personalstyrka som omfattar 6000 personer, lokalanställda såväl som internationella. Organisationen är till största del självimplementerade, och för 2018 uppskattats att endast två procent av den totala budgeten kommer att vidareförmedlas till tredje part.\n\nSida utför årligen en humanitär allokeringsprocess som ligger till grund för vilka organisationer, landprogram och tematiska / kapacitetsstärkande projekt som ska beviljas finansiellt stöd. I enlighet med denna process bedömer Sida det relevant att under 2018 stödja NRCs humanitära program i 21 länder, samt i ett antal tematiska och externa projekt. Sida avser ingå fleråriga stöd där ett mervärde för detta identifierats. Detta då möjliggörandet av långsiktig planering ligger i linje med Sidas ambition att skapa förutsägbarhet för partnerorganisationer. Uppdelningen av stödet sker enligt nedan: \n \nLandprogram:\n2018: Afghanistan, Eritrea, Etiopien, Irak, Iran, Jemen, Jordanien, Kamerun, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Nigeria, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Syriska Arabiska Republiken, Uganda och Ukraina. \n\n2018-2019: Centralafrikanska Republiken och Demokratiska Republiken Kongo.\n\nSida avser bidra med fastslagna summor per land, men dessa kan sedan användas som oöronmärkta inom respektive lands program, vilket ger NRC flexibilitet att möta de mest akuta humanitära behoven i föränderliga kontexter. För 2018 öronmärks stöd till Information Councelling and Legal Assistance (ICLA) programmet i Palestina då Sida anser att NRCs huvudsakliga mervärde i den specifika kontexten återfinns inom ICLA-programmet.\n\n\n2018-2019: Rapid Response Mechanimsm\nSida stöd till NRCs Rapid Reponse Mechanism möjliggör att NRC snabbt kan svara mot plötsligt uppkomna eller förvärrade kriser.\n\n\nTematiska projekt: \n2018: Strenghtening Global Protection Policy, NRC digital transformation och CaspCap.\n\n2018-2019: Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre\n\nSida föreslår att finansiellt bidra till NRC skyddsarbete genom deras projekt Strenghtening Global Protection Policy som bl a åsyftar stärka det globala humanitära systemet och humanitär policy, och till det NRC/NORCAP-ledda arbetet med stärkandet av kontantbaserat stöd och marknadsanpassade lösningar inom humanitärt bistånd (CaspCap). Sida föreslår också stöd till NRCs interna projekt som riktas mot att förbättra deras digitala lösningar med syfte att leverera bättre bistånd, och till det NRC-ledda arbetet av Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) som verkar för ökad kunskap om internflyktingar. \n\n\nExterna projekt: \n\n2018: NGO plattform Palestina, NGO plattform Jordanien, NGO plattform Libanon.\nSida avser bidra med stöd till tre NGO-plattformar i Palestina, Libanon och Jordanien genom NRC. För Palestina är dessa medel delegerade från Palestinas finansieringskod, beslutsnr 2018-000465, men inordnas under det aktuella avtalet med NRC då detta bedöms kunna bidra till effektivitetsvinster i myndighetens hantering.\n\nSida bedömer NRCs program som relevanta i förhållande till strategin för humanitärt bistånd genom Sida 2017 – 2020 samt de humanitära behov som identifierats i och med Sidas humanitära allokeringsprocess för 2018. NRC var under 2017 Sidas största humanitära NGO-partner, och väntas med detta beslut bli det även 2018.\n\nSida och NRC har samarbetat sedan 2005 och NRC beviljades 2013 strategisk humanitär partnerskapsstatus hos Sida. Sidas innevarande stöd till NRC omfattar ett treårigt samarbetsavtal för humanitär verksamhet (2017-2019), med årliga arbetsplaner och tillhörande budget. \nSida bedömer att samtliga medel för NRCs program 2018 ska utbetalas omgående för att möjliggöra planering och uppstart av verksamheten 1 januari 2018. Detta för att på bästa sätt möjliggöra planering och genomförande av den humanitära insatsen utan fördröjning. Ett avsteg från Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms motiverat. \n\nSidas stöd i aktuell insats är programbaserat, d v s att NRC har rätt att inom ett landprogram fritt fördela medel inom de projekt i landet som bedöms lämpligast. Härigenom ges NRC en hög grad av flexibilitet avseende landprogrammens utformning. Vad gäller stödet till s.k. RRM-insatser samt tematiska och externa projekt ges NRC i dessa rätt att omallokera medel upp till 10 % av projektbudgeten. Detta bedöms motiverat för att NRC effektivt ska kunna möta uppkommande humanitära behov. För större ändringar, eller omallokering mellan länder, krävs Sidas godkännande.\n\nBedömningspromemorian har skrivits på engelska med anledning av att engelskspråkig personal i fält är delaktig i beredning och uppföljning av insatsen, i enlighet med Generaldirektörens beslut om Sidas språkvalsmatris med tillämpningsanvisningar från den 1 mars 2013.', 'In accordance with Sida’s humanitarian allocation process 2018, Sida proposes to support NRC’s humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries; Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. Sida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection.  The support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida’s ambition to increase our partner’s predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.Sida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC’s Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises.   Furthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project “Strengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action”, to NRC\'s internal work on ""Digital Transformation"" and to NRC’s work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.Sida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms; the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).  In regard to AIDA, the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement, and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding, with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy, decision number XXX XXXXNRC’s target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced persons but also when relevant, host communities and returnees. NRC is working within its six core competencies (sectors); shelter, livelihoods and food security, education, water and sanitation, camp management and legal advice.Sida’s support to NRC comprises a three year agreement for humanitarian activities, for which funding is decided each year based on Sida’s allocation process and NRC’s yearly application. Additional funding is granted through supplementary decisions throughout the year.UPDATE 2021Increasingly NRC is developing its programming on the basis of a gender analysis. It is mainstreaming gender across its 6 core competencies of the humanitarian response. The reporting is still to be improved for capturing performances and outcomes regarding the gender perspective in NRC\'s programmes. NRC is not yet equipped to track the age dimension of the gender perspective in its monitoring framework, but will address this gap as recommended by Sida. This partnership agreement was extended to 31 December 2020 for the activity period. In 2020, NRC received 402.7 mkr in total for its humanitarian programmes and projects, including 330.9 mkr for crisis response in 26 settings, 50 mkr for RRMs and 21.8 mkr for capacity development. Bringing the total of this partnership to 1,306,200,000 kr for the 2017-2020 cycle.', 'In June 2017 NRC’s Board of Directors approved NRC’s new Global Strategy 2018-2020, which outlines NRC’s main ambition and strategic direction of further strengthening the work to provide assistance, protection and durable solutions to people affected by displacement worldwide.  Based on its strategic directions, NRC will strive to achieve four main ambitions: - Be the leading displacement organisations in hard-to-reach areas; - Be a champion for durable solutions; - Become a leader in using data and technology to deliver better; - Be a great organisation to work for.  NRC’s mission statement commits NRC to “provide assistance to meet immediate humanitarian needs, prevent further displacement and contribute to durable solutions”.  In addition, NRC presents to Sida intended results at an outcome and output level on a sector level in each specific country.

The contribution also includes support to the IASC Gender and Protection Capacity Project (GenCap and ProCap).\n\nThe intervention has been extended to cover a financial support o SEK 125 million for the time period of jan - dec 2022. The goals of the intervention remain the same.', ""Den föreslagna insatsen gäller stöd till FN:s humanitära samordningsorgan OCHA:s (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) verksamhet på land- och regional nivå i linje med dess nya strategiska plan för 2018-21. OCHA är en entitet inom FN-sekretariatet, som har av FN:s generalförsamling (resolution 46/182, december 1991) erhållit ett mandat att stödja samordning av humanitär respons. Den verkar globalt genom sitt huvudkvarter i New York och Geneve, 29 landkontor och sex regionala kontor.  \n\nDen FN-ledda humanitära samordningen är en prioriterad fråga för svensk humanitär politik. Sverige har sedan grundandet av OCHA bidragit både med ett stort finansiellt och ett viktigt politiskt stöd. Sverige är idag efter USA och Storbritannien den tredje största givaren till OCHA och Sidas stöd har på senare år stått för cirka hälften av det totala svenska bidraget. Sverige är också en av de största givarna till OCHA:s humanitära fonder, både landfonderna (CBPF) genom Sida och den centrala nödfonden (CERF) genom bidrag från UD. \n\nOCHA verkar i en global humanitär miljö där de humanitära behoven och komplexiteten ständigt ökar. I 2018 är 136 miljoner människor i behov av humanitärt bistånd i 25 länder, av vilka de flesta är i konflikt. Trots att den humanitära finansieringen totalt sett har ökat växer gapet mellan finansiering och behov. Under senare år har enbart dryga hälften av behoven finansierats och i 2018 vädjar man om sammanlagt om 22,5 miljarder dollar för att svara upp mot de FN-ledda gemensamma responsplanerna. Samtidigt måste systemet förhålla sig till allt fler förlängda och kroniska kriser, ofta på grund av avsaknaden av hållbara politiska lösningar. Komplexiteten av kriserna fördjupas ytterligare av klimatrelaterade risker och naturkatastrofer. Även det humanitära systemet ändras och diversifieras i takt med att en allt större del av responsen hanteras av lokala, nationella och regionala aktörer.   \n\nMot ovan beskriva globala humanitära kontext OCHA:s mervärde bedömer Sida att behovet av effektiv humanitär samordning är fortsatt mycket stort. Därför är ett fortsatt stöd till OCHA:s samorning i fält motiverat. De samordningsmekansimer som OCHA tillhandahåller är en förutsättning för en behovsbaserad, välprioriterande kollektiv respons.\n\nOCHA:s mervärde som humanitär aktör utgår från dess unika mandat, där den som icke-operativ aktör kan agera som en oberoende facilitator och samordnare mellan de humanitära organisationer som deltar i en respons, både internationella och nationella. \n- Samordningsfunktionen innefattar bland annat den årliga planeringscykeln, där OCHA för samman sektorgrupperna (sk. klustren) för att analysera behovsbilden för att sedan ta fram en gemensam humanitär responsplan (Humanitarian Response Plan, HRP). De gemensamma responsplanerna är ett viktigt led i att prioritera de mest akuta behoven och på så sätt även utnyttja knappa finansiella resurser på ett effektivt sätt. Sida erfar att genom OCHA:s och i vissa fall starka humanitära koordinatorers (Humanitarian Coordinator, HC) insatser har responsplaner blivit mer prioriterande och till större grad begränsade till livräddande insatser. Samtidigt finns det fler exempel på att gemensam planering med utvecklingssystemet, som i längden kan bidra till att minska humanitära behov. \n- I sin roll som oberoende facilitator kan OCHA också agera å det humanitära systemets vägnar mot myndigheter och militär, och på så sätt till exempel förhandla om humanitärt tillträde. Detta kan innebära både förhandling om passage för enskilda hjälpinsatser över konfliktgränser, om större regelverk kring tillträde, eller exempelvis frågor kring registrering av organisationer och arbetstillstånd för humanitär personal i länder där myndigheter på så sätt skapar hinder för en effektiv respons. Den här typen av samlade insatser är av stor betydelse i den allt mer restriktiva miljö som organisationer arbetar i. \n- Ett ytterligare exempel på den unika kompetens som OCHA tillför är dess informationsprodukter och data-analys, som används som verktyg för operativa beslut och underlag för humanitärt påverkansarbete. \n\nSida bedömer att OCHA:s mervärde kommer under kommande år ytterligare öka i takt med att den strikt sektorbaserade responsen blir mindre relevant i förlängda kriser, och inte minst genom att flersektoriella modaliteter som kontantbaserade stöd vinner mark.  \n\nDenna insats bygger vidare på tidigare års stöd till OCHA och särskilt det avtal som Sida haft med OCHA under den tidigare strategiperioden 2014-18. Det utgångna avtalet inkluderade två-åriga finansieringsåtaganden för att bidra till förutsägbarheten av OCHA:s finansiering. Flerårig finansiering är särskilt värdefullt för OCHA, vars budget består primärt av löner.  \n\nDet nya avtalet som föreslås är fyraårigt i linje med OCHA:s strategiska plan 2018-21. Insatsen är uppdelad i två komponenter. Den huvudsakliga komponenten består av stöd till OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor och kompletteras av ett mindre metodstöd till Gender Standby Capacity Project (GenCap) och Protection Standby Capacity Project (ProCap), som OCHA-står värd för.   \n\n1. OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor \n\nStödet till OCHA:s fältkontor ges icke-öronmärkt till kontorens verksamhet i enlighet med OCHA:s strategiska plan och den årliga verksamhetsplanen och budgeten (OCHA Plan and Budget). Fältkontoren bidrar till alla fem av OCHA:s kärnfunktioner genom att: (1) samordna den kollektiva humanitära responsen, inklusive genom gemensamma behovsbedömningar och responsplaner; (2) bidra med informantionsprodukter och analys; (3) driva påverkansarbete för att skydda drabbade människor och förhandla humanitärt tillträde, (4) bidra till humanitär policy och (5) mobilisera humanitär finansiering. Insatsen kompletterar Sidas stöd till de humanitära landfonderna (ref. 52040531) som också hanteras av OCHA:s landkontor men finansieras direkt ur givarmedel till fonderna.\n\nSida genomför årligen en humanitär allokeringsprocess, vari samtliga humanitära kriser analyseras utifrån de humanitära behoven och där de mest relevanta av strategiska partnerorganisationer att svara upp mot identifierade behov utväljs. Det nu aktuella stödet till OCHA baseras därigenom på Sidas humanitära\nallokeringsprocess, vilken färdigställdes under slutet av 2017. Det föreslagna stödet till OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor är 118 miljoner kronor i 2018 och föreslås fördelas enligt nedan. \n\nLandkontor, totalt 84 miljoner kronor: Afghanistan 3, Burundi 1, Kamerun 4, Centralafrikanska republiken 5, Tchad 4, Colombia 2, DRK 7, Etiopien 2, Haiti 1, Irak 3, Libyen 1, Mali 4, Myanmar 2, Niger 4, Nigeria 4, Pakistan 3, Palestina 4, Filippinerna 1, Somalia 5, Sydsudan 5, Sudan 3, Syrienkrisen 10 (inklusive Regional HC's Office, Syrien, Turkiet, Libanon och Jordanien), Ukraina 1, Jemen 5.  \n\nRegionala kontor, totalt 14 miljoner kronor: Asien (Bangkok) 4, Södra och östra Afrika (Nairobi) 2, Mellanöstern och Nordafrika (Amman) 2, Stillahavsregionen (Suva) 1, Västra och centrala Afrika (Dakar) 4, Latinamerika (Panama) 1. Av stödet till Asien-kontoret kommer 2 miljoner fördelas till OCHA:s verksamhet i Nordkorea.  \n\nEtt särskilt bidrag på 20 miljoner kronor föreslås att avtalas och utbetalas som oallokerat stöd, som OCHA kan använda under året för plötsligt uppkomna, kraftigt förvärrade eller underfinansierade kriser. De oallokerade medlen regleras genom avtalet som fastställer att OCHA ska inkomma med kompletterande underlag som skriftligen ska godkännas av Sida före medlen kan nyttjas av OCHA.\n\nInnanför bemyndiganderamen föreslås ett bidrag om 25 miljoner kronor för 2019, 5 miljoner kronor för 2020 och 5 miljoner kronor för 2021. De slutliga bidragen för 2019-21 kommande definieras som en del av Sidas årliga, behovsbaserade allokeringsprocess och kräver separata beslut och avtalstillägg, under förutsättning att riksdagen anvisar nödvändiga finansiella medel.  \n\n2. GenCap och ProCap \n\nStöd till GenCap och ProCap föreslås med 7 miljoner kronor för 2018, av vilka 4 miljoner kronor fördelas till GenCap och 3 miljoner till ProCap, i enlighet med den årliga GenCap-och ProCap-appellen. Syftet med projekten är att skicka ut tekniska rådgivare inom gender och skydd till stöd för den kollektiva humanitära responsen på landnivå. Uppdragen har ett systemfokus och verkar inom ramen för etablerade samordningsmekanismer, och kan därför ses som ett tematiskt komplement till stödet till OCHA. OCHA kommer inom kort inkomma med ett nytt strategiskt ramverk för GenCap och ProCap. Sidas bidrag avser att täcka kostnaderna för de utsända experterna genom vidareförmedling till Norska flyktingrådet (NRC), som ansvarar för administrationen av expertrostern och uppdragen.      \n\nVad gäller utbetalningar bedömer Sida att samtliga medel för OCHA:s land- och regionala kontor ska utbetalas omgående. Detta för att på bästa sätt möjliggöra planering och genomförande av den humanitära insatsen utan fördröjning. Enligt OCHA används Sidas tidiga bidrag i nära anslutning till utbetalningen. Ett avsteg från Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms därför motiverat. Medel till GenCap och ProCap (7 miljoner kronor) betalas ut först efter att OCHA inkommit med kompletterande underlag i form av ett slutligt strategidokument, slutlig appell för 2018, och ett för Sida godtagbart utkast på resultatsramverk och en uppföljnings- och utvärderingsplan. Det sistnämna bedöms vara tillgängligt under andra kvartalet 2018, alltså beräknas utbetalning ske senast i juni. En senare utbetalning är motiverad eftersom det handlar om ett metodstöd, dvs. är inte av livräddande karaktär.   \n\n\nAvtalsutkastet har tagits fram i samråd med ansvarig jurist på JUR och bygger på tidigare avtalsformat kompletterat med en ny reglering av parternas ambition att motverka anti-korruption. Skrivningen i artikel 11 skiljer sig åt i några avseenden jämfört med Sidas avtal med OCHA om stödet till de humanitära landfonderna (se beslut 2018-000231). Skillnaderna avser rapportering av ärenden och ansvaret för utredningar vilka regleras något olika beroende på om FN:s interna regelverk för Sekretariatet gäller när OCHA har ett samlat ansvar för genomförandet (såsom i det föreslagna stödet) jämfört med rollen som koordinator inom FN-systemet vad gäller landfonderna genom vilket ansvaret är fördelat på de implementerande organisationerna. Som stöd för den föreslagna lydelsen har OCHA delat gällande regelverk för Sekretariatet mot antikorruption (beslutat Sept 2016: ”United Nations Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework” ) och även delat det interna regelverket för upphandling som gäller för hela FN-systemet (”United Nations Procurement Manual, revision 7”Juli 2013). Sida bedömer att regelverken är tillfredsställande.\n\nBedömningspromemorian har skrivits på engelska med anledning av att engelskspråkig personal i fält är delaktig i beredning och uppföljning av insatsen, i enlighet med generaldirektörens beslut om Sidas språkvalsmatris med tillämpningsanvisningar från den 1 mars 2013 (när så är motiverat).\n\nDenna insats har förlängts med 1 år och Sida har tillskjutit nya medel om SEK 125 miljoner.

This is achieved through secondments to UN agencies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and international NGOs, but also through logistical support and housing and office solutions. The current grant agreement between Sida and MSB covers the period 2022-2025.\nAs a Swedish governmental agency, MSB and its part in Sida’s humanitarian assistance facilitates broader relations in the countries they operate in and with the organizations they cooperate with. A significant part of MSB’s humanitarian operations aims to enable humanitarian activities in hard to reach areas, including by creating the necessary conditions for UN agencies and international NGOs to live, work and operate in those areas through housing and office solutions. MSB also contributes to strengthening the UN system through their thematic expertise by seconding specialists and experts in an array of thematic areas. In the previous agreement period, MSB showcased good results and is deemed to play a relevant role in the operationalization of the Swedish humanitarian assistance strategy. In line with Sida’s ambitions to move towards multi-year funding, MSB is granted funding for three of the four years in the new grant period, amounting to a total of 390 000 000 SEK (130 000 000 SEK per year).

We will engage in a programme of rigorous anthropological research that will involve extended interviews with migrants, local communities, NGO staff and policy makers. We will also carry out extensive observational research in a range of settings such as reception centres, migrant support groups and other community-based locations. Working in collaboration with humanitarian organisations and local government authorities, we will use this data to inform migration policies in the region.', 'Research and development activity contributing to the UK’s strategy to address key development challenges.']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL']",2470972bc4f931c35e026a941cbfec42,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],"['refugees', 'host_communities']","['urban', 'rural']","['Mediterranean', 'Italy', 'Greece', 'European Countries', 'south Italy', 'eastern Aegean islands', 'UK']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL']",[],2025-06-04T10:21:48.918442

It will offer insights into the care of separated migrant children in England, starting from the premise that care is not necessarily limited to that provided by an adult or the state. Our pilot studies demonstrate that a crucial way separated migrant children survive the challenges of migration and settlement is through the care they provide and receive from other migrant children. Using creative research methods designed to involve separated migrant children and adult stakeholders in reflecting on their understandings and experiences of care, this project will not only point to 'cracks in the system' (Rosen et al., 2017) but offer insights into what constitutes good practice and how to develop it.\n\nThis project sits against the backdrop of the displacement of over 65.6 million people globally, many of whom are children. Whilst some have moved with adult family members, the number who have been separated from primary carers at some point during their migration journeys has risen dramatically (Unicef, 2016). Often referred to as 'unaccompanied minors' in legal and policy contexts, we use the term 'separated child migrants' to highlight that many children maintain transnational relationships or reunite with parents at various points in the migration process, and are often accompanied by other kin and non-kin adults and children (Rosen, forthcoming).\n\nWhen separated migrant children arrive in the UK, they face conflicting treatment. They are protected as 'children' and entitled to the same rights to care as all other children. But, they are often treated as 'suspect' and excluded from welfare provision because of their status as 'migrants' (Crafter, forthcoming). Previous research has highlighted that the tension between immigration control and protection has led to significant differences in the quality of care provided for separated migrant children. New policy and guidance about separated migrant children is both responding to and changing the way these tensions are handled in the UK with, as yet, unknown consequences. In any case, they do not take children's care for each other into account.\n\nLittle is known about separated children's care for each other as they navigate contradictory, complex, and changeable immigration and welfare systems. Nor do we know how separated children's care for each other is understood and treated by relevant adult stakeholders, including social workers, foster carers, educators, youth workers, religious leaders, legal professionals, and policy makers. Our pilot studies indicate this neglect means that policies and practices designed to support separated child migrants can end up harming, excluding or discriminating against them. For instance, children who care for each other may be forcibly separated in foster care placements, go 'missing' trying to reunite, or have their 'child' status questioned.\n\nIn response, this project makes a needed and timely intervention. Placing separated children at its heart, this study asks: What are separated child migrants' experiences of care and caring for others? How do various economic, social and political factors shape the care priorities of relevant stakeholders? What are the theoretical, policy, and practice implications of varying understandings and practices of care?\n\nThis project has been designed by a multidisciplinary research team in collaboration with a range of local and national charities including Refugee Youth and MEENA (for migrant children and women in Birmingham), and involves the Refugee Council, Coram Children's Legal Project, and Barnardo's in an Advisory Group. This broad-based team ensures that the project will have meaningful impact on the lives of separated migrant children."", 'Research and development activity contributing to the UK’s strategy to address key development challenges.']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL']",8454ae646b3083001b0a8d0498244f68,['mixed_or_unspecified_refugees'],['refugees'],['urban'],"['England', 'UK']","['humanitarian', 'development']","['DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY & INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC & SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL']","['Refugee Youth', 'MEENA', 'Refugee Council', ""Coram Children's Legal Project"", ""Barnardo's""]",2025-06-04T10:21:55.801658
